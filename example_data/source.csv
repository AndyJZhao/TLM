"Notably, the frequency response of the rectangular filter is the sinc function (the rectangular function and the sinc function are Fourier dual to each other), and thus truncation of a filter in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by the rectangular filter, thus convolution by the sinc filter in the frequency domain, causing ripple.

"In symbols, the frequency response of formula_7 is formula_8 In particular, truncating the sinc function itself yields formula_9 in the time domain, and formula_10 in the frequency domain, so just as low-pass filtering (truncating in the frequency domain) causes ""ringing"" in the time domain, truncating in the time domain (windowing by a rectangular filter) causes ""ripple"" in the frequency domain. JPEG compression can introduce ringing artifacts at sharp transitions, which are particularly visible in text. This is a due to loss of high frequency components, as in step response ringing.

"JPEG uses 8×8 blocks, on which the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is performed. The DCT is a Fourier-related transform, and ringing occurs because of loss of high frequency components or loss of precision in high frequency components. They can also occur at the edge of an image: since JPEG splits images into 8×8 blocks, if an image is not an integer number of blocks, the edge cannot easily be encoded, and solutions such as filling with a black border create a sharp transition in the source, hence ringing artifacts in the encoded image.

"The (causal) echo after the transient is not heard, because it is masked by the transient, an effect called temporal masking. Thus only the (anti-causal) echo before the transient is heard, and the phenomenon is called pre-echo. This phenomenon occurs as a compression artifact in audio compression algorithms that use Fourier-related transforms, such as MP3, AAC, and Vorbis. Other phenomena have similar symptoms to ringing, but are otherwise distinct in their causes.
",4
"In cases where these cause circular artifacts around point sources, these may be referred to as ""rings"" due to the round shape (formally, an annulus), which is unrelated to the ""ringing"" (oscillatory decay) frequency phenomenon discussed on this page. Edge enhancement, which aims to increase edges, may cause ringing phenomena, particularly under repeated application, such as by a DVD player followed by a television. This may be done by ""high""-pass filtering, rather than low-pass filtering.

"Although the idea for the serpentine facade must have been conceived fairly early on, probably in the mid-1630s, it was only constructed towards the end of Borromini's life and the upper part was not completed until after the architect's death. Borromini devised the complex ground plan of the church from interlocking geometrical configurations, a typical Borromini device for constructing plans.
",6
"However, the pattern of these artifacts need not be similar to ringing (as discussed on this page) – they may exhibit oscillatory decay (circles of decreasing intensity), or other intensity patterns, such as a single bright band. Ghosting is a form of television interference where an image is repeated. Though this is not ringing, it can be interpreted as convolution with a function, which is 1 at the origin and ε (the intensity of the ghost) at some distance, which is formally similar to the above functions (a single discrete peak, rather than continuous oscillation).
",7
"Many special functions exhibit oscillatory decay, and thus convolving with such a function yields ringing in the output; one may consider these ringing, or restrict the term to unintended artifacts in frequency domain signal processing. Fraunhofer diffraction yields the Airy disk as point spread function, which has a ringing pattern. The Bessel function of the first kind, formula_11 which is related to the Airy function, exhibits such decay. In cameras, a combination of defocus and spherical aberration can yield circular artifacts (""ring"" patterns).
",8
"Ringing also occurs in the wavelet-based JPEG 2000. JPEG and JPEG 2000 have other artifacts, as illustrated above, such as blocking (""jaggies"") and edge busyness (""mosquito noise""), though these are due to specifics of the formats, and are not ringing as discussed here. Some illustrations: In audio signal processing, ringing can cause echoes to occur before and after transients, such as the impulsive sound from percussion instruments, such as cymbals (this is ""impulse"" ringing).

"The immune system is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to detect and destroy invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can make people sick. The immune system provides two different types of immunity: * Innate immunity — This type is provided by natural barriers in the body, substances in the blood, and specific types of cells that attack and kill foreign cells that invade the body.

"These systems work together to make, store, and move specialized cells (such as B cells and T cells) and molecules (such as antibodies) that recognize specific identifying parts (antigens) of invading organisms, ridding the body of viruses, bacteria, or parasites that have these antigens. This process can be tricky because, in order for the immune system to destroy foreign invaders, it has to be able to recognize what is a part of the body (""self"" or ""auto"") and what is not part of the body (""non-self"").

Some very rare NHL types are not shown in the graph. In addition and for simplicity, NHL types are often grouped according to how quickly they grow: * Indolent lymphomas (also called low-grade lymphomas) usually grow slowly and tend to initially cause few symptoms.

"While indolent lymphomas are generally not curable (similar in some ways to diabetes, which is not curable but manageable), patients can potentially live a long time with these types of lymphomas because they tend to respond well to treatment and can remain in remission for many years (even decades). Although these lymphomas are slow growing, they tend to be more widespread at diagnosis than aggressive lymphomas. Over time, some indolent lymphomas may ""transform"" or develop into aggressive lymphomas.

"Lung function tests are done to make sure that the body can withstand treatment with certain lymphoma drugs that may stress a patient's lung function (for example, bleomycin and cyclophosphamide). A doctor may order breathing tests (pulmonary functions tests [PFTs]) before beginning treatment and at other times during treatment to make sure that a patient's lungs are still working properly. How Is NHL Staged? Staging is used to describe how widely the cancer has spread in patients with NHL. The Ann Arbor staging system has been used for staging NHLs other than CLL.
",92
"Although the older staging system is still in use, a modification of the Ann Arbor staging system—the Lugano Classification—was proposed in 2014, which is shown in the following figure. There are two main classifications (limited and advanced disease) and four stages of lymphoma designated by the Roman numerals I through IV. Stages I and II are considered limited disease, although Stage II can be considered advanced in some cases. Stages III and IV are considered advanced disease. Staging is not to be confused with grade. These are not the same. Grade is the number of large cells seen under the microscope.

"Although testing of the N-156F was successful, demonstrating unprecedented reliability and proving superior in the ground-attack role to the USAF's existing North American F-100 Super Sabres, official interest in the Northrop type waned, and by 1960 it looked as if the program was a failure. Interest revived in 1961 when the United States Army tested it, (along with the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and Fiat G.91) for reconnaissance and close-support.
",94
"Doctors use the stage of disease, test results, and/or other factors to help decide the best time to begin treatment and what treatments are likely to be the most effective for each patient. Being diagnosed with advanced NHL is common in most patients. Keep in mind that these advanced stages can be successfully treated. The Ann Arbor staging system is used to stage SLL but not CLL. Rather, the Rai staging system is commonly used in the United States to stage CLL, and the Binet classification system is more popular in Europe.
",95
"Staging of NHL (Lugano Classification) Stage II disease that is also called bulky, meaning that the patient has a tumor greater than 10 centimeters (4 inches) wide depending on the type of NHL, can sometimes be considered advanced disease. The newer staging system is similar to the previous Ann Arbor staging system, except that the ""A"" and ""B"" designations are no longer used except for the staging of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

"Without a uniform standard, each library might choose to categorize the subject matter of their items differently. The widespread use and acceptance of the ""Library of Congress Subject Headings"" facilitates the uniform access and retrieval of items in libraries across the world using the same search strategy and LCSH thesaurus, if the correct headings have been applied to the item by the library. Some LCSH decisions involve a great amount of debate and even controversy in the library community. LCSH is the world's most widely used subject vocabulary.

"Despite LCSH's wide-ranging and comprehensive scope, libraries that deal with more specific types of collections or user communities may use other vocabularies; for example, many medical libraries in the United States use the National Library of Medicine's Medical Subject Headings. In Canada, the National Library of Canada worked with LCSH representatives to create a complementary set of Canadian Subject Headings (CSH) to express the topic content of documents on Canada and Canadian topics.

"Open communication with the healthcare team can help patients and caregivers better learn about what the prescribed treatment regimen is, how it works, what tests are involved, and what side effects and complications may be associated with it. A good first step for patients is to write down all questions that come to mind. Before meeting with a doctor or nurse, for the first time or for follow-up visits, patients should consider organizing questions into a list to bring to the visit. Since time with doctors or nurses may be limited, patients should put the two or three most important questions at the top of their list.
",114
"Moreover, users unfamiliar with OPAC searching and LCSH, may incorrectly assume their library has no items on their desired topic, if they chose to search by 'subject' field, and the terms they entered do not strictly conform to a LCSH. For example, 'body temperature regulation' is used in place of 'thermoregulation'. Thus the easiest way to find and use LCSH is to start with a 'keyword' search and then look at the Subject Headings of a relevant item to locate other related material.

"Most oncology nurses are also very well informed about cancer treatments and are a good source of information on a wide range of topics. Additionally, oncology social workers are available to assist with practical, emotional and other support needs from the time diagnosis is received and onward. Although family members are often very concerned about their loved one and want information concerning his or her care, confidentiality rules prohibit doctors from giving out information to anyone without the patient's expressed permission. For efficiency, designate one family member as the family contact. The patient must remember to specifically tell the doctor the identity of the primary family contact.

"Sanford Berman, a notable American science scholar on this subject, has also pointed out the difficulty in finding material on certain topics, such as various denialisms, because the natural language terms for them, climate change denialism, for example, have not been incorporated into LCSH.

Works about heterosexuality are scarcely labeled as such in LCSH, giving users the impression that only queer sexuality deserves examination because heterosexuality is the norm.

"Many patients feel better when they actively participate in their own care. Ask questions, learn about options, and work closely with the doctor. It is important for patients to be comfortable with the doctors and the approaches they take. If patients or caregivers are not comfortable, they should openly discuss their concerns. Confidence in the medical team often leads to confidence in treatment. If there is a feeling the team is not a good match, patients should ask for a referral to a different healthcare team.

"Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions. These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency. In combustion engines, various steps are taken to eliminate a flame. The method depends mainly on whether the fuel is oil, wood, or a high-energy fuel such as jet fuel. The adiabatic flame temperature of a given fuel and oxidizer pair is that at which the gases achieve stable combustion.

"When light strikes the interface between a medium with refractive index ""n"" and a second medium with refractive index ""n"", both reflection and refraction of the light may occur. The Fresnel equations describe the ratios of the reflected and transmitted waves' electric fields to the incident wave's electric field (the waves' magnetic fields can also be related using similar coefficients). Since these are complex ratios, they describe not only the relative amplitude, but phase shifts between the waves. The equations assume the interface between the media is flat and that the media are homogeneous and isotropic.

"Thus, for clarity, all jumps will be described for a skater jumping counter-clockwise. There are six jumps in figure skating that count as jump elements. All six are landed on one foot on the back outside edge (with counter-clockwise rotation, for single and multi-revolution jumps), but have different takeoffs, by which they may be distinguished. The two categories of jumps are toe jumps and edge jumps. The number of rotations performed in the air determines whether the jump is a single, double, triple, or quadruple (commonly known as a ""quad"").

" The Ascian Language is a fictional language invented by Gene Wolfe for his science fiction series ""The Book of the New Sun"". The language is spoken by the inhabitants of the “northern continents” of the future earth, the ""Ascians"", who are enslaved by their masters (the ""Group of Seventeen"") in a way much like the people of Oceania in George Orwell's book ""1984"". The Ascian language consists of two levels: On the low level it is just an ordinary language, of whose syntax, grammar and vocabulary virtually nothing is known. What makes the language unique is the second level.
",291
"Although Ascian is their mother tongue, adult Ascians don't understand plain Ascian sentences, unless they are direct quotations from governmental propaganda materials (called ""Correct Thought""). So, in order to communicate, an Ascian has to know by heart thousands of these quotations (sentences) on many different topics. As the northern continents are at war with the southern ""Commonwealth"" (where most protagonists of the books live), there are interpreters in the Ascian army to interrogate prisoners.

"When learning to spin, a skater will typically learn a forward spin first, then once that is mastered they will learn how to execute a back spin. When performing some types of spin, an elite skater can complete on average six rotations per second, and up to 70 rotations in a single spin. However, this is rarely seen in modern competitions because it would gain no extra points for the spin. Spins are normally entered on the ice, but they can also be entered from a jump or sequence of jumps known as star jumps.
",293
"This corresponds to the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis. Nevertheless, Gene Wolfe suggests that this concept doesn't work out like that. It is shown that intelligent Ascians are very well able to express, by means of approved sentences only, meanings that exceed those of the quoted sources. They simply quote sentences which have certain connotations, regardless of the actual meaning of the approved text.
",294
"These speak the language of the Commonwealth, but as they are unable to think outside the approved texts, what they say is just literal translations of the Ascian approved sentences. A very similar concept of a language is presented in the """" episode ""Darmok"" from 1991. The reason for the ""Group of Seventeen"" to impose on their people this complicated concept of a language is much like Orwell’s concept of Newspeak. In order to prevent the Ascians from ever developing critical thought (and subsequently inciting revolts), the language is limited as to make it impossible to express it.

"The ability to skate well backwards and forwards are considered to be equally important, as is the ability to transition well between the two. Step sequences are a required element in all four Olympic disciplines. The pattern can be straight line, circular, or serpentine. The step sequence consists of a combination of turns, steps, hops and edge changes. Additionally, steps and turns can be used as transitions between elements. The various turns, which skaters can incorporate into step sequences, include: Choctaws are the two-foot equivalents of rockers and counters.

"A spiral is an element in which the skater moves across the ice on a specific edge with the free leg held at hip level or above. Spirals are distinguished by the edge of the blade used (inside or outside), the direction of motion (forward or backward), and the skater's position. A spiral sequence is one or more spiral positions and edges done in sequence. Judges look at the depth, stability, and control of the skating edge, speed and ice coverage, extension, and other factors. Some skaters are able to change edges during a spiral, i.e. from inside to outside edge.

Under both the 6.0 system and the ISU Judging System, the judges consider the ""complete package"" when evaluating performances, i.e. the best jumper is not always placed first if the judges consider the difference in jumping execution to be outweighed by another skater's speed, spins, presentation, etc.

"The marks for each program ran from 0.0 to 6.0, the latter being the highest. These marks were used to determine a preference ranking, or ""ordinal"", separately for each judge; the judges' preferences were then combined to determine placements for each skater in each program. The placements for the two programs were then combined, with the free skate placement weighted more heavily than the short program. The highest placing individual (based on the sum of the weighted placements) was declared the winner.

"Each element is judged first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its ""base value"". This is done using instant replay video to verify features that distinguish different elements; e.g. the exact foot position at take-off and landing of a jump. A panel of twelve judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This mark, called the ""grade of execution"" (GOE), is an integer with a minimum value of –5 and a maximum value of +5.
",303
"The GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322. The GOE value from the twelve judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, the highest and lowest values are then discarded, and finally the average of the remaining seven is calculated. This average value is then added to (or subtracted from) the base value to determine the total value for the element. Note: The IJS previously used a GOE scale of –3 to +3 but this was changed for the 2018–19 season and is in the early stages of being tested in competitions.

"The ""program components score"" (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded in the ""total element score"". The components are: A detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2.

",305
"The trimmed mean scores are then translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score. The ""total element score"" and the ""program components score"" are added to give the total score for a competition segment (TSS). A skater's final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.

" In computers it is typical to define rules relative to data transfers for optimizing the overall system considerations. One such consideration is to define coherency granules (CG) that relate to units of data that are stored in memory. These units generally have a close relationship to caches that may be used in the system. The Coherency Granule size typically corresponds to the cache line size in a computer system. The hardware is designed with the assumption that coherency granules will be the data packets that are typically transferred in a cache coherent system when accessing coherent data.

"The magnitude of the coherency granule is typically significantly greater than the bus size. For example, in current processing systems, the coherency granule is commonly 32 bytes, and the bus size is 8 bytes wide. In such a case, a data transfer of one coherency granule requires 4 cycles on the bus. The hardware is designed to optimize, for example by using burst techniques, the performance of such transfers. Thus a burst transfer of a coherency granule will take less time than two transfers each of a half of a coherency granule.

The latest revision of the language (Fortran 2018) was earlier referred to as Fortran 2015. It is a significant revision and was released on November 28, 2018. Fortran 2018 incorporates two previously published Technical Specifications: Additional changes and new features include support for ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 (the version of the IEEE floating point standard before the latest minor revision IEEE 754-2019), hexadecimal input/output, IMPLICIT NONE enhancements and other changes.

"Although a 1968 journal article by the authors of BASIC already described FORTRAN as ""old-fashioned"", Fortran has now been in use for several decades and there is a vast body of Fortran software in daily use throughout the scientific and engineering communities. Jay Pasachoff wrote in 1984 that ""physics and astronomy students simply have to learn FORTRAN. So much exists in FORTRAN that it seems unlikely that scientists will change to Pascal, Modula-2, or whatever.""

"In 1993, Cecil E. Leith called FORTRAN the ""mother tongue of scientific computing"", adding that its replacement by any other possible language ""may remain a forlorn hope"". It is the primary language for some of the most intensive super-computing tasks, such as in astronomy, climate modeling, computational chemistry, computational economics, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, data analysis, hydrological modeling, numerical linear algebra and numerical libraries (LAPACK, IMSL and NAG), optimization, satellite simulation, structural engineering, and weather prediction.

"Many of the floating-point benchmarks to gauge the performance of new computer processors, such as the floating-point components of the SPEC benchmarks (e.g., CFP2006, CFP2017) are written in Fortran. Apart from this, more modern codes in computational science generally use large program libraries, such as METIS for graph partitioning, PETSc or Trilinos for linear algebra capabilities, DUNE or FEniCS for mesh and finite element support, and other generic libraries.

"Although careful programmers were coming to realize that use of incompatible extensions caused expensive portability problems, and were therefore using programs such as ""The PFORT Verifier,"" it was not until after the 1977 standard, when the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) published ""FIPS PUB 69"", that processors purchased by the U.S. Government were required to diagnose extensions of the standard. Rather than offer two processors, essentially every compiler eventually had at least an option to diagnose extensions. Incompatible extensions were not the only portability problem.

"For numerical calculations, it is important to take account of the characteristics of the arithmetic. This was addressed by Fox et al. in the context of the 1966 standard by the ""PORT"" library. The ideas therein became widely used, and were eventually incorporated into the 1990 standard by way of intrinsic inquiry functions. The widespread (now almost universal) adoption of the IEEE 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic has essentially removed this problem. Access to the computing environment (e.g., the program's command line, environment variables, textual explanation of error conditions) remained a problem until it was addressed by the 2003 standard.

IBM Research Labs also developed an extended FORTRAN-based language called ""VECTRAN"" for processing vectors and matrices.

"Object-Oriented Fortran was an object-oriented extension of Fortran, in which data items can be grouped into objects, which can be instantiated and executed in parallel. It was available for Sun, Iris, iPSC, and nCUBE, but is no longer supported.

The major remaining extension is OpenMP, which is a cross-platform extension for shared memory programming. One new extension, Coarray Fortran, is intended to support parallel programming.

"""FOR TRANSIT"" was the name of a reduced version of the IBM 704 FORTRAN language, which was implemented for the IBM 650, using a translator program developed at Carnegie in the late 1950s. The following comment appears in the IBM Reference Manual (""FOR TRANSIT Automatic Coding System"" C28-4038, Copyright 1957, 1959 by IBM): The FORTRAN system was designed for a more complex machine than the 650, and consequently some of the 32 statements found in the FORTRAN Programmer's Reference Manual are not acceptable to the FOR TRANSIT system.

"Three passes were required to translate source code to the ""IT"" language, then to compile the IT statements into SOAP assembly language, and finally to produce the object program, which could then be loaded into the machine to run the program (using punched cards for data input, and outputting results onto punched cards). Two versions existed for the 650s with a 2000 word memory drum: FOR TRANSIT I (S) and FOR TRANSIT II, the latter for machines equipped with indexing registers and automatic floating point decimal (bi-quinary) arithmetic.

" Two types of language change can be characterized as linguistic drift: a unidirectional short-term and cyclic long-term drift. According to Sapir, drift is the unconscious change in natural language. He gives the example ""Whom did you see?"" which is grammatically correct but is generally replaced by ""Who did you see?"" Structural symmetry seems to have brought about the change: all other ""wh-"" words are monomorphic (consisting of only one morpheme). The drift of speech changes dialects and, in long terms, it generates new languages.

"Appendix A of the manual included wiring diagrams for the IBM 533 card reader/punch control panel. Prior to FORTRAN 77, a number of preprocessors were commonly used to provide a friendlier language, with the advantage that the preprocessed code could be compiled on any machine with a standard FORTRAN compiler. These preprocessors would typically support structured programming, variable names longer than six characters, additional data types, conditional compilation, and even macro capabilities.

"For example, in Shanghai Chinese (Shanghainese) it has been reported that vowel sounds have gradually changed over time due to the influence of Mandarin Chinese (Yao & Chang, 2016). At a shorter timescale (weeks of intensive exposure to a second language) as well, phonetic changes have been observed in an individual's native language; these changes, termed 'phonetic drift', generally approximate properties of the second language.

"A down side to this simplified environment was that WATFOR was not a good choice for programmers needing the expanded abilities of their host processor(s), e.g., WATFOR typically had very limited access to I/O devices. WATFOR was succeeded by WATFIV and its later versions. LRLTRAN was developed at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory to provide support for vector arithmetic and dynamic storage, among other extensions to support systems programming.

The following program illustrates dynamic memory allocation and array-based operations, two features introduced with Fortran 90. Particularly noteworthy is the absence of loops and / statements in manipulating the array; mathematical operations are applied to the array as a whole. Also apparent is the use of descriptive variable names and general code formatting that conform with contemporary programming style.

"To the extent that a language is vocabulary cast into the mould of a particular syntax and that the basic structure of the sentence is held together by functional items, with the lexical items filling in the blanks, syntactic change is no doubt what modifies most deeply the physiognomy of a particular language. Syntactic change affects grammar in its morphological and syntactic aspects and is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to cyclic drift.

" In telecommunication, a drift is a comparatively long-term change in an attribute, value, or operational parameter of a system or equipment. The drift should be characterized, such as ""diurnal frequency drift"" and ""output level drift.""

Drift is also common in pseudo-synchronised streaming applications, such as low-latency audio streaming over TCP/IP.

"Cyclic drift is the mechanism of long-term evolution that changes the functional characteristics of a language over time, such as the reversible drifts from SOV word order to SVO and from synthetic inflection to analytic observable as typological parameters in the syntax of language families and of areal groupings of languages open to investigation over long periods of time.

" A viewshed is an area that is visible from a specific location. Viewshed analyses are a common function of most geographic information system (GIS) software. The analysis uses the elevation value of each cell of the digital elevation model (DEM) to determine visibility to or from a particular cell. The location of this particular cell varies depending on the needs of the analysis. For example, a viewshed analysis is commonly used to locate communication towers or determining the view from a road. Viewsheds can be calculated using an individual point such as a tower or multiple points such as a line representing a road.

"When analyzing a line segment, each of the vertices along the line is calculated to determine its visible area. The process can also be reversed. For example, when locating a landfill, the analysis can determine from where the landfill is visible to keep it hidden from view.

" Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis which studies the transformations of functions and their algebraic and topological properties. The field builds upon and abstracts the results of Joseph Fourier's 1822 paper, ""Théorie analytique de la chaleur"" (The Analytical Theory of Heat), which demonstrated how a change of basis by means of the Fourier transform could be used to permit manipulations of a function in the frequency domain to obtain insights that were previously unobtainable. Functional analysis has modern applications in many areas of algebra, in particular associative algebra, in probability, operator theory, wavelets and wavelet transforms.

"The functional data analysis (FDA) paradigm of James O. Ramsay and Bernard Silverman ties functional analysis into principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction. Functional analysis has strong parallels with linear algebra, as both fields are based on vector spaces as the core algebraic structure. Functional analysis endows linear algebra with concepts from topology (e.g. inner product, norm, topological space) in defining the topological vector space (TVS), which strengthens notions of continuity and limit, and supports generalization to infinite-dimensional spaces. The core operation within a TVS is linear transformation.
",515
"An important part of functional analysis is the extension of the theory of measure, integration, and probability to infinite dimensional spaces, also known as infinite dimensional analysis. Additionally, functional analysis generalizes the concept of an orthonormal basis—as found in Fourier analysis—to arbitrary inner product spaces, including those of infinite dimension. Important theoretical results include the Banach–Steinhaus theorem, spectral theorem (central to operator theory), Hahn–Banach theorem, open mapping theorem, and the closed graph theorem.

"The final variable used in the viewshed analysis is the radius value. In the case of the radio tower, if the radio signal has a limited range, perhaps 10 miles, then the radius variable can be set to limit the viewshed analysis to a 10-mile radius. Besides tower placement a viewshed analysis can be used for other applications. For example, a viewshed analysis could estimate the impact of the addition of a large building. The viewshed analysis would show all the areas from which the building could be seen as well as any views that would be obscured from any particular location.

"However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra. The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular Maurice René Fréchet and Paul Lévy. Hadamard also founded the modern school of linear functional analysis further developed by Frigyes Riesz and the Polish Lwów School of Mathematics centered around Stefan Banach. The basic and historically first class of spaces studied in functional analysis are complete normed vector spaces over the real or complex numbers. Such spaces are called Banach spaces.

"Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are fully understood in linear algebra, and infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces are isomorphic to formula_1. Separability being important for applications, functional analysis of Hilbert spaces consequently mostly deals with this space. One of the open problems in functional analysis is to prove that every bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space has a proper invariant subspace. Many special cases of this invariant subspace problem have already been proven. General Banach spaces are more complicated than Hilbert spaces, and cannot be classified in such a simple manner as those.
",520
"An important example is a Hilbert space, where the norm arises from an inner product. These spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. More generally, functional analysis includes the study of Fréchet spaces and other topological vector spaces not endowed with a norm. An important object of study in functional analysis are the continuous linear operators defined on Banach and Hilbert spaces. These lead naturally to the definition of C*-algebras and other operator algebras. Hilbert spaces can be completely classified: there is a unique Hilbert space up to isomorphism for every cardinality of the orthonormal basis.

"That is, we require Then it is not necessary to deal with equivalence classes, and the space is denoted formula_15, written more simply formula_16 in the case when formula_5 is the set of non-negative integers.

A Banach space can be canonically identified with a subspace of its bidual, which is the dual of its dual space. The corresponding map is an isometry but in general not onto.

" Little Red Riding Hood is a 1997 black and white short film based on the traditional children's fairytale ""Little Red Riding Hood"". Written and directed by David Kaplan, it features Christina Ricci in the title role. The film bears similarities to some of the earliest versions of the fairytale, including the Italian ""La finta nonna"" (The False Grandmother). This version of the classic children's story employs elements of black comedy. The black-and-white scenario shows the forest of the tale, and narrator Quentin Crisp is the only voice heard in the film.

"Generally, Japanese sea bass eggs are distributed between bay water and outer water because thermohaline regions are formed. However, once their eggs have developed, they are shifted from the surface layer to the middle layer of water. The water temperature where the eggs are placed in a significant factor for the survival rate since their eggs do not tolerate temperatures below 10 °C. The eggs of this species are pelagic, spherical, colorless, and measure about 1.34mm to 1.44mm in diameter with a single oil globule.

"Operating systems and protocols designed as recently as a few years ago when networks were slower were tuned for BDPs of orders of magnitude smaller, with implications for limited achievable performance. The original TCP configurations supported ""TCP receive window size"" buffers of up to 65,535 (64 KiB - 1) bytes, which was adequate for slow links or links with small RTTs. Larger buffers are required by the high performance options described below. Buffering is used throughout high performance network systems to handle delays in the system.
",616
"In general, buffer size will need to be scaled proportionally to the amount of data ""in flight"" at any time. For very high performance applications that are not sensitive to network delays, it is possible to interpose large end to end buffering delays by putting in intermediate data storage points in an end to end system, and then to use automated and scheduled non-real-time data transfers to get the data to their final endpoints. Maximum achievable throughput for a single TCP connection is determined by different factors. One trivial limitation is the maximum bandwidth of the slowest link in the path.

"> Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven—Matthew 18:3 While I have written negatively about childishness, this scripture is speaking of something completely different. A child like quality is necessary for us to remain lowly and humble, and to follow our heart. It also reflects a true type of ""dependence.""
",618
"Because TCP transmits data up to the window size before waiting for the acknowledgements, the full bandwidth of the network may not always get used. The limitation caused by window size can be calculated as follows: formula_1 where RWIN is the TCP Receive Window and RTT is the round-trip time for the path. At any given time, the window advertised by the receive side of TCP corresponds to the amount of free receive memory it has allocated for this connection. Otherwise it would risk dropping received packets due to lack of space.
",619
"From the Bible we know at least five things beyond controversy: 1. ""Jehovah"" is a name used in the popular King James Bible 2. There are three persons of Elohim, Father, Son and Holy Spirit 3. We know that Jesus is a Greek word meaning anointed one 4. We know that ""Yehoshua"" or ""Yeshua"" is the original [in English letter form] Hebrew 5.
",620
"The sending side should ""also"" allocate the same amount of memory as the receive side for good performance. That is because, even after data has been sent on the network, the sending side must hold it in memory until it has been acknowledged as successfully received, just in case it would have to be retransmitted. If the receiver is far away, acknowledgments will take a long time to arrive. If the send memory is small, it can saturate and block emission. A simple computation gives the same optimal send memory size as for the receive memory size given above.
",621
"A number of extensions have been made to TCP over the years to increase its performance over fast high-RTT links (""long fat networks"" or LFNs). TCP ""timestamps"" (RFC 1323) play a double role: they avoid ambiguities due to the 32-bit sequence number field wrapping around, and they allow more precise RTT estimation in the presence of multiple losses per RTT. With those improvements, it becomes reasonable to increase the TCP window beyond 64 kB, which can be done using the ""window scaling"" option (RFC 1323).

"But there are also other, less obvious limits for TCP throughput. Bit errors can create a limitation for the connection as well as RTT. In computer networking, RWIN (TCP Receive Window) is the amount of data that a computer can accept without acknowledging the sender. If the sender has not received acknowledgement for the first packet it sent, it will stop and wait and if this wait exceeds a certain limit, it may even retransmit.

"On the one hand, it slows down GTP hydrolysis by EF-Tu by 12-fold and the peptidyl transfer reaction by two-fold. It also causes a 1.5-fold increase in the amount of GTP hydrolyzed per peptidyl transfer, which indicates that a lot of proofreading is required. Moreover, because it is just a modified adenosine base, mA base-pairs with uridine during decoding. However, the adenosine's methylation hinders tRNA accommodation and translation elongation.
",659
"When a mA-modified codon interacts with its cognate tRNA (the tRNA with the anticodon that is complementary to a particular codon), it acts more like a near-cognate codon interaction instead of the cognate codon interaction. This can be seen in the delay in the tRNA accommodation, which is dependent upon both the position of the mA in the mRNA codons and on how accurate the translation is. Overall, this mA modification leads to a kinetic loss of a factor of 18.

"To summarize, translation-elongation dynamics are slower for codons with mA and different locations of these modified nucleotides in the mRNA codons affect decoding dynamics in different ways. However, this mark can also increase translational efficiency. The mA ""reader"" YTHDF1 induces the association of the modified mRNA with the ribosome. Furthermore, it also recruits the translation initiation factor eIF3 to the mRNA independently of METTL3.

While these writers have been identified, as of now, there are no known mC ""erasers""; in a broader sense, this means that reamination, or the conversion of 5-methylcytosine back into cytosine, has not been observed in RNA. 5-methylcytosine modifications are typically found approximately 100 nucleotides downstream of translation initiation sites.

"The artificial process of pseudouridylation has an effect on the function of mRNA: it changes the genetic code by making non-canonical base pairing possible in the ribosome decoding center. Pseudouridylation reactions are catalyzed by enzymes that contain the pseudouridine synthase domain; 13 such enzymes have been identified in humans, which are called pseudouridine syntheses (PUS). These enzymes can be either RNA-dependent or RNA-independent depending on whether a small RNA is needed to guide the enzyme to its target or not.

"The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the 'Ice Age', spanned from 126,000 YBP–11,700 YBP and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene epoch. This arctic environment was very cold and dry and probably dusty, resembling mountaintop environments, and was very different from today's swampy tundra. It reached its peak during the last glacial maximum, when ice sheets commenced advancing from 33,000 years BP and reached their maximum positions 26,500 years BP.
",672
"Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000 years BP, and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 years BP, which is consistent with evidence that it was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level at that time. During the peak of the last glacial maximum, a vast mammoth steppe stretched from the Iberian Peninsula across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon where it was stopped by the Wisconsin glaciation. This land bridge existed because more of the planet's water was locked up in ice than now and therefore the sea levels were lower.
",673
"When the sea levels began to rise this bridge was inundated around 11,000 years BP. During glacial periods, there is clear evidence for intense aridity due to water being held in glaciers and their associated effects on climate. The mammoth steppe was like a huge 'inner court' that was surrounded on all sides by moisture-blocking features: massive continental glaciers, high mountains, and frozen seas. These kept rainfall low and created more days with clear skies than are seen today, which increased evaporation in the summer leading to aridity, and radiation of warmth from the ground into the black night sky in the winter leading to cold.

"Some modifications include pseudouridines, 2′-O-methylations on backbone sugars, and methylated bases. It is not well known what the biological effects of these modifications are on the rRNA molecule, but one hypothesis is that they help stabilize the structure and enhance the function of the ribosome, especially during ribosome formation. Moreover, these modifications may alter the chemical properties of the rRNA such that the correct tertiary structure is favored. 2'-O-methylation prevents backbone hydrolysis; other noted modifications also seem to help with stabilizing rRNA secondary structures and preventing damage to rRNA strands.
",677
"A primary example of this is the methylation of guanosine at junctions within the tRNA structure. These methylguanosine impact the overall tertiary structure by disrupting any potential canonical hydrogen bonding (hydrogen bonds that are conventional Watson-Crick base pairs), thus creating a loop at the core of the tRNA. Other modifications are integral for creating and maintaining the extreme bends in the structure. Messenger RNA is the bridge between the genetic code and the resulting proteins, as it is what carries the necessary information that gets translated into proteins.

"Typically, under normal cell conditions, the modification stoichiometry is very low, there are a very few number of transcripts that have specific modifications. However, as cell conditions change, the fraction of modified transcripts can change as well. As with other types of RNA, modifications impact the overall structure of the mRNA. Altering its structure may cause the mRNA to take different paths.

Consider a renaissance painting of Moses, or of Elijah. There is no way that an artist can time travel, or guess the face of either of these prophets. There is not enough scientific data to give even the painters of today's world this kind of information. The only way they can do this is because of a spiritual talent. They do it by the heart, and it is a divine or counterfeit divine process.

"This goes back to Gerhard Huisken's extension of Hamilton's work to higher dimensions, where the main part of the work is that the Weyl tensor and the semi-traceless Riemann tensor become zero in the long-time limit. This extends to the more general Ricci flow convergence theorems, some expositions of which directly use the Schur lemma. This includes the proof of the differentiable sphere theorem. The Schur lemma for Codazzi tensors is employed directly in Huisken's foundational paper on convergence of mean curvature flow, which was modeled on Hamilton's work.

The game headed to overtime. During overtime, UConn took a lead and maintained it, until Syracuse finally tied the score to force another overtime. This pattern continued for five overtimes, where in each one, UConn took and maintained a lead, only to have Syracuse tie the score before time ran out.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"" (1792) by Mary Wollstonecraft, is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ""A Room of One's Own"" (1929) by Virginia Woolf, is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

" Bismuthia is a rare dermatological condition that results from the prolonged use of bismuth. Much more rarely than with silver, bismuth may produce a generalized persistent skin discoloration resembling argyria. The conjunctivae and oral mucosa, as well as skin, are commonly afflicted by the condition. Pigment granules are evenly scattered through the dermis, producing a blue, or bluish gray skin color by the scattering phenomenon. It is extremely rare, and as a consequence is poorly understood by modern medicine.

Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality.

"### Using Emotions For Convincing Holy Acting With regard to _emotions_ , Joseph used his feelings of anger in order to lend a convincing face to his accusations of his brothers. In already being angry, he did not have to feign anger. He could use the _emotion_ of anger in order to help him to be convincing as a _Holy Actor_. Through these deceptive actions Joseph forced his brothers to treat him in a way he had never been treated by them before. Previously seeking to destroy him, they now feared his every command.

" In mathematics and abstract algebra, the two-element Boolean algebra is the Boolean algebra whose ""underlying set"" (or universe or ""carrier"") ""B"" is the Boolean domain. The elements of the Boolean domain are 1 and 0 by convention, so that ""B"" = {0, 1}. Paul Halmos's name for this algebra ""2"" has some following in the literature, and will be employed here. ""B"" is a partially ordered set and the elements of ""B"" are also its bounds.

"An operation of arity ""n"" is a mapping from ""B"" to ""B"". Boolean algebra consists of two binary operations and unary complementation. The binary operations have been named and notated in various ways. Here they are called 'sum' and 'product', and notated by infix '+' and '∙', respectively. Sum and product commute and associate, as in the usual algebra of real numbers. As for the order of operations, brackets are decisive if present. Otherwise '∙' precedes '+'.
",865
"Hence ""A∙B + C"" is parsed as ""(A∙B) + C"" and not as ""A∙(B + C)"". Complementation is denoted by writing an overbar over its argument. The numerical analog of the complement of ""X"" is 1 − ""X"". In the language of universal algebra, a Boolean algebra is a formula_1 algebra of type formula_2. Either one-to-one correspondence between {0,1} and {""True"",""False""} yields classical bivalent logic in equational form, with complementation read as NOT.

"Like the concept of antimatter, it has the quality of being ""uncreated."" If the life we know is ""something,"" then it must be it's counterpart; namely, ""nothing."" Thus we could use the word ""nothingness."" However, I must state that ""nothing"" does not refer to ""nothing"" as in a blank space, for even a space is ""some-thing.""

"This gives it the nature of being ""the cause"" rather than ""the effect."" The Godhead is a marvel, the power and awesomeness of it is beyond thinking. It is not constrained, it does not have any definition.

"### Ordinariness There is a way in which we need to fight against the mechanism of True Enlightenment. The reason we need to fight it is because YEHOVA is a consuming fire, and if we do not fight it we will become burned up. To do this, it is acceptable to use various means to reconstruct and consolidate the temporal, created self. Such means may involve very ordinary activities, walks, food and thinking. We must think ourselves back into duality, because if we do not do so then we risk losing our sanity.

"#### Partial Duality Partial duality is an awesome thing to teach. I love it a lot, and it is extremely rarely taught. Partial duality means that we operate from the level of a very high self-concept. This thin, high self-concept is a useful place for us to consider ourselves to be. It helps us to live a life wherein we are co-operative with the Divine purpose. We have enough individual existence to maintain a usable identity, but enough Godhead to bring a greater light.

These gifts can include insights from YEHOVA, through other people. It is true that King Solomon had his failings, but this is not because he allowed entrance into his kingdom. The mistake was that he allowed the closest place in his heart to become compromised.

"There were to be two different structures, each with their own staff. In order to receive public funds, a party must provide evidence of regular political activity, present complete lists of candidates at the legislative and European elections, and have received at least 2% of the vote. The function of the Chamber of Deputies is covered under Chapter IV of the Constitution of Luxembourg, the first article of which states that the purpose of the Chamber is to represent the country. Luxembourg is a parliamentary democracy, in which the Chamber is elected by universal suffrage under the d'Hondt method of Party-list proportional representation. All laws must be passed by the Chamber.

"For this we also need to become students of life with the Holy Spirit as the teacher. We cannot force ourselves upon the world. To force ourselves on the world is not really something which places us in co-operation with the power of the Holy Spirit working in and ruling over our life. ### Rightly Dividing The Word Of Truth Once again we see how this divides us from our _leavened_ brethren, who, in having a bare glimpse of the truth feel obliged to preach their beliefs to everyone they meet. We on the other hand, restrain ourselves, for we have locked within us great gifts which are awesome and mysterious.

Today, test pilots and trainer pilots play simulations in which they try to land aircraft under the same conditions. United pilot Mike Hamilton said, ""I'm not aware of any that replicated the success these guys had. Most of the simulations never even made it close to the ground."" Susan Callander, a flight attendant on United Flight 232, said, ""To be one of those pilots, they are all heroes, and he played an instrumental role in saving all those lives.

"It is not a matter of mere spiritual belief, though real belief is indeed part and parcel of faith. What I am attempting to describe here is how we should all be aware that social activities such as groups of friends, events such as parties and gatherings, families, clubs and sporting groups, hobbies and online such as Facebook and Twitter are fundamentally _spiritual_ activities. They are already spiritual, and it is the existing spiritual realities that we should strive not to be ignorant of. In doing this we will be wise and not fools.

"In relation to the 'Punicity' of Moroccan sites such as Lixus, Professor Josephine Crawley Quinn stresses an ambiguity: ""It is not in fact easy to demonstrate any occupation of coastal sites by Carthaginian colonists or other settlers, since most of the sites traditionally labelled 'Punic' could be interpreted equally well as indigenous settlements engaged in the exchange of local products for imported goods."" Lixus flourished during the Roman Empire, mainly when the emperor Claudius (AD 41-54) established the province of Africa with full rights for the citizens.

"This can be difficult, for it is very possible that the Unleavened Gospel can place you in a place of temporary isolation. ### Purposeful Action We strive to be purposeful in what we do. Since we have no purpose ourselves but follow the instruction to ""take no thought for the morrow"", then we live lives which are according to our calling. We don't perform actions which have no purpose for us. It is not that everything we do has a direct, Christian purpose, but rather that our _whole lives_ are yoked to Elohim.
",909
"### Activities to which we are called Activities to which we are _called_ refers to more important, social, complex situations such as those already discussed in this chapter. It refers to anything where the consequences have real effects on the life of the disciple and on other lives. To this measure, disciples of Yehoshua do not organise or attend social activities through their own decision-making or because it feels good to their flesh. They will only go if they have been _called_ to go.
",910
"Such a _calling_ can involve a _visual_ sense or _prophetic_ insight, a sense that it feels right(coming from the Holy Spirit and not the flesh) or some type of word. We can ask and receive detailed instructions, but realise that we also have to strive for knowledge. Sometimes we are made to push forward and work for breakthroughs in our interactions with the world (At times Elohim himself has placed resistance in front of my attendance, but I knew He wanted me to fight against it.

"The major seas and oceans (for warships) and the sky (for warplanes) are similarly divided into different regions. These provinces each have a type of terrain assigned to them that determines how well different types of units will perform in combat there. Divisions are placed in provinces and can attack enemy units in adjacent provinces. How well divisions perform in combat depends on various factors, such as the quality of their equipment, the weather, the type of terrain, the skill and traits of the general commanding the divisions, and the morale of both sides.

"We can view the Catholic view of sex as being a window into the human soul in its unsanctified condition. The Catholic makes no effort to actually change their condition, beyond mere human and religious effort. Yehoshua is not the source of any change in their life, since they don't know Him. This means that nothing is any different to the ordinary human being, except that emphasis is placed on the religious aspects of the old man. Their views, while seeming spiritual, are only what could be called ""the spiritual side of the flesh.""

"Combined with the ambiguous position of titled heirs of members of the ""Mekwanint"", Emperor Haile Selassie, as part of his programme of modernising reforms, and in line with his aims of centralising power away from the ""Mesafint"", replaced the traditional system of precedence with a simplified, Western-inspired system that gave precedence by rank, and then by seniority based when the title had been assumed irrespective of how the title was acquired. The Negusa Nagast ( , ""King of Kings"") was the Emperor of Ethiopia.

"All formal speech concerning the Emperor was in the plural, as was his own speech; Haile Selassie, for instance, referred to himself in the first-person plural at all times, even in casual conversation and when speaking in French (however this was not the case when he spoke in English, in which he was not fully fluent). The Nigiste Negestatt (ንግሥተ ነገሥታት ) was Empress Regnant in her own right, literally ""Queen of Kings,"" or ""Queen of Queens,"" or ""female ruler of an empire.""

"Is it somehow evil and will it mess people up? In one sense it will, but this can be a necessary evil. The fallen angels know that practices such as homosexuality and Sado Masochism exist. These acts are not what people think they are. They are never merely about pleasure.

"Historians until the late 20th century emphasised class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution. The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, with support from the sans-culottes, who fought to destroy the aristocracy. However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support.

We are heterosexual or divine bisexual. It does not exist, and has not been created by YEHOVA. For this reason, we must know that Gay-marriage is an abomination.

"For instance, it can be frightening to some to believe that certain forms of homosexuality are tolerable, and that gay-marriage however is an abomination. How can you ensure that you don't go to Hell. But the answer is the same as what I have discussed before. We must learn to hear from YEHOVA. I would say ""even"" but I say ""especially"" the common Christian, who lives by reasoned and thought out doctrinal morals, must learn to hear from YEHOVA. If they don't, then even in a very safe seeming life, they are at great danger.

"One possible outcome could be that an altered human nature could end in radical inequality.

"Out of these, we do not try to control it, and we should be wary if the fallen angels are involved. But since we live in the world, we do not always avoid these interactions, of which any sexual interactions reflect real world interactions. Think about Solomon.

It is not correct to say it is a sin because of mixing sexual energy with a fallen angel. Sometimes it is acceptable.

Martin described it as being based on the principle of cohesion, as described by Tom DeMarco in his book ""Structured Analysis and System Specification"", and Meilir Page-Jones in ""The Practical Guide to Structured Systems Design"". In 2014 Martin wrote a blog post entitled The Single Responsibility Principle with a goal to clarify what was meant by the phrase ""reason for change.""

"The id is not worse from the absolute perspective. It is simply lower; it can be sanctified, so that we have the strength and courage for ministry. The unsanctified state might be paranoia, gut anger and hostility, which are not a good foundation (even if not physical this still represents ""living by the sword""). There is more to the id than what might be considered by our socially instilled judgements: The Aztec civilisation had a great strength for engineering. They pioneered in construction, and the id is still required today for construction. A rational grasp of mathematics will not make an engineer.

"The single-responsibility principle says that these two aspects of the problem are really two separate responsibilities, and should, therefore, be in separate classes or modules. It would be a bad design to couple two things that change for different reasons at different times. The reason it is important to keep a class focused on a single concern is that it makes the class more robust. Continuing with the foregoing example, if there is a change to the report compilation process, there is a greater danger that the printing code will break if it is part of the same class.

"As unleavened gospel disciples we are no longer allowed to place money first. This, as it turns out, is one of the keys to the transition between civilised and spiritual man. The demarcation of the line between savage and civilised was in moving the focus away from tribal bonding and aggression into broader community-belonging placing a high value on reason. In counterfeit spirituality, the focus moves once again. Man places the focus in the spiritual part of his nature. #### Retaining The Lower Order In much the same way that the savage nature did not disappear, the civilised nature also does not disappear.

"Some signs, such as the sign commonly used for the letter ""C"", may be one-handed. Manual alphabets based on the Arabic alphabet, the Ethiopian Ge'ez script and the Korean Hangul script use handshapes that are more or less iconic representations of the characters in the writing system.

" The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, which it should encapsulate. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility. Robert C. Martin, the originator of the term, expresses the principle as, ""A class should have only one reason to change,"" although, because of confusion around the word ""reason"" he more recently stated ""This principle is about people.""

"### The Upshot I am speaking of the world, but realise the implications for ministry. Today's church has a civilised focus, but in the change to the new dispensation it must have a spiritual focus. In the past it was possible to have a tribal or a civilised focus and still technically place YEHOVA first in our lives and be saved. This is not my point here. The Jews were first rather tribal and kept laws, but as we move forward in dispensation we are called to be more spiritual in our mode of relationship.

"Martin defines a responsibility as a ""reason to change"", and concludes that a class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed (e.g. rewritten). As an example, consider a module that compiles and prints a report. Imagine such a module can be changed for two reasons. First, the content of the report could change. Second, the format of the report could change. These two things change for very different causes; one substantive, and one cosmetic.

"Fingerspelling is used in different sign languages and registers for different purposes. It may be used to represent words from an oral language which have no sign equivalent, or for emphasis, clarification, or when teaching or learning a sign language. In American Sign Language (ASL), more lexical items are fingerspelled in casual conversation than in formal or narrative signing. Different sign language speech communities use fingerspelling to a greater or lesser degree. At the high end of the scale, fingerspelling makes up about 8.7% of casual signing in ASL, and 10% of casual signing in Auslan.

"The proportion is higher in older signers, suggesting that the use of fingerspelling has diminished over time. Across the Tasman Sea, only 2.5% of the corpus of New Zealand Sign Language was found to be fingerspelling. Fingerspelling has only become a part of NZSL since the 1980s; prior to that, words could be spelled or initialised by tracing letters in the air. Fingerspelling does not seem to be used much in the sign languages of Eastern Europe, except in schools, and Italian Sign Language is also said to use very little fingerspelling, and mainly for foreign words.

"## Spiritual Relationships In order to form functional relationships we need to relate to others on the level of the spirit. This sounds like it might be too abstract, but I can assure you that when it is not done, a dysfunction in the relationship is the result. We need to start seeing people as spirits, and not as bodies. To do this we need to overcome the ingrained and relentlessly powerful tendency to view the world around us as a mass of solid objects and physical bodies. It is not only physicality that we are seeking to escape the trap of. Identities, too are objects.
",941
"The spirit of a person assumes an identity to itself—yet it is not that identity. Spirit is a subject, not an object. The spirit of a person is a subject. The physical body and the identity are objects. Subjects can form the basis of lasting relationships. Objects cannot. When we have spiritual relationships we get two achievements: 1) We have excellent relationships with people in person. 2) We can effectively relate with people who are not physically present with us. Spirit, being subjective, is not contained in time and space. At higher stages of development, remote spiritual communions and conversations are powerful.

"Most of the letters of the BSL alphabet are produced with two hands, but when one hand is occupied, the dominant hand may fingerspell onto an ""imaginary"" subordinate hand, and the word can be recognised by the movement. As with written words, the first and last letters and the length of the word are the most significant factors for recognition. When people fluent in sign language read fingerspelling, they do not usually look at the signer's hand(s), but maintain eye contact and look at the face of the signer as is normal for sign language.

"As unleavened disciples we think of the 8 dispensations of which we are entering the 7th—the tribulation period of the Millennial Reign.

"Sign languages that make no use of fingerspelling at all include Kata Kolok and Ban Khor Sign Language. The speed and clarity of fingerspelling also varies between different signing communities.

"In the Nepali Sign Language it is only four ""letters"" which derive from the American manual alphabet: अ /a/, ब /b/, म /m/, and र /r/). The Yugoslav manual alphabet represents characters from the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet as well as Gaj's Latin alphabet. Fingerspelling has been introduced into certain sign languages by educators, and as such has some structural properties that are unlike the visually motivated and multi-layered signs that are typical in deaf sign languages. In many ways fingerspelling serves as a bridge between the sign language and the oral language that surrounds it.

"The first book on deaf education, published in 1620 by Juan Pablo Bonet in Madrid, included a detailed account of the use of a manual alphabet to teach deaf students to read and speak.

"Arthrological systems had been in use by hearing people for some time; some have speculated that they can be traced to early Ogham manual alphabets. The vowels of this alphabet have survived in the contemporary alphabets used in British Sign Language, Auslan and New Zealand Sign Language. The earliest known printed pictures of consonants of the modern two-handed alphabet appeared in 1698 with ""Digiti Lingua"", a pamphlet by an anonymous author who was himself unable to speak. He suggested that the manual alphabet could also be used by mutes, for silence and secrecy, or purely for entertainment.

"Nine of its letters can be traced to earlier alphabets, and 17 letters of the modern two-handed alphabet can be found among the two sets of 26 handshapes depicted. Charles de La Fin published a book in 1692 describing an alphabetic system where pointing to a body part represented the first letter of the part (e.g. Brow=B), and vowels were located on the fingertips as with the other British systems. He described codes for both English and Latin. By 1720, the British manual alphabet had found more or less its present form.

"The northernmost of the two fast tracks (as mentioned above) was later removed, and the remaining fast (through) track was also removed in late 2006. Judging by the new track layout east of the station, this arrangement seems to be permanent. After the engineering work of 2007 was finally completed after a lengthy delay that had lasted from the beginning of the year, the stations two platforms have become bi-directional platforms. This means that both platforms can be used for trains going in either direction. Such as when the fast Waterloo service, the xx34 is running late behind the slow Waterloo service xx40.

" Whilst most commonly used for small shunting engines, on some railways the term 'Pug' was used for all tank engines. For example, the very large Glasgow and South Western Railway 540 Class 4-6-4T express passenger locomotives were known to their enginemen as the 'Big Pugs'. Many locomotive manufacturers produced Pug type locomotives mainly for shunting work and for use on industrial sites with tight curves for which 0-6-0 locomotives were less well suited, despite their greater tractive effort capabilities.

"The adsorbed ion has no chemical reaction with the atoms of the electrode (no chemical bonds arise) since only a charge-transfer takes place. Faradaic pseudocapacitance only occurs together with static double-layer capacitance. Pseudocapacitance and double-layer capacitance both contribute inseparably to the total capacitance value. The amount of pseudocapacitance depends on the surface area, material and structure of the electrodes.
",972
"Pseudocapacitance may contribute more capacitance than double-layer capacitance for the same surface area by 100x. The amount of electric charge stored in a pseudocapacitance is linearly proportional to the applied voltage. The unit of pseudocapacitance is farad. Redox reactions in batteries with faradaic charge-transfer between an electrolyte and the surface of an electrode were characterized decades ago. These chemical processes are associated with chemical reactions of the electrode materials usually with attendant phase changes.

"Pseudocapacitive processes lead to a charge-dependent, linear capacitive behavior, as well as the accomplishment of non-faradaic double-layer capacitance in contrast to batteries, which have a nearly charge-independent behavior. The amount of pseudocapacitance depends on the surface area, material and structure of the electrodes. The pseudocapacitance may exceed the value of double-layer capacitance for the same surface area by 100x. Applying a voltage at the capacitor terminals moves the polarized ions or charged atoms in the electrolyte to the opposite polarized electrode.
",976
"Between the surfaces of the electrodes and the adjacent electrolyte an electric double-layer forms. One layer of ions on the electrode surface and the second layer of adjacent polarized and solvated ions in the electrolyte move to the opposite polarized electrode. The two ion layers are separated by a single layer of electrolyte molecules. Between the two layers, a static electric field forms that results in double-layer capacitance.
",977
"Accompanied by the electric double-layer, some de-solvated electrolyte ions pervade the separating solvent layer and are adsorbed by the electrode's surface atoms. They are specifically adsorbed and deliver their charge to the electrode. In other words, the ions in the electrolyte within the Helmholtz double-layer also act as electron donors and transfer electrons to the electrode atoms, resulting in a faradaic current.
",978
"The electrons involved in the faradaic processes are transferred to or from the electrode's valence-electron states (orbitals) and flow through the external circuit to the opposite electrode where a second double-layer with an equal number of opposite-charged ions forms. The electrons remain in the strongly ionized and electrode surface's ""electron hungry"" transition-metal ions and are not transferred to the adsorbed ions. This kind of pseudocapacitance has a linear function within narrow limits and is determined by the potential-dependent degree of surface coverage of the adsorbed anions.

"The storage capacity of the pseudocapacitance is limited by the finite quantity of reagent or of available surface. Systems that give rise to pseudocapacitance: All three types of electrochemical processes have appeared in supercapacitors. When discharging pseudocapacitance, the charge transfer is reversed and the ions or atoms leave the double-layer and spread throughout the electrolyte. Electrodes' ability to produce pseudocapacitance strongly depends on the electrode materials' chemical affinity to the ions adsorbed on the electrode surface as well as on the electrode pore structure and dimension.
",982
"The electron transfer reaction takes place according to: During charge and discharge, (protons) are incorporated into or removed from the crystal lattice, which generates storage of electrical energy without chemical transformation. The OH groups are deposited as a molecular layer on the electrode surface and remain in the region of the Helmholtz layer. Since the measurable voltage from the redox reaction is proportional to the charged state, the reaction behaves like a capacitor rather than a battery, whose voltage is largely independent of the state of charge. Another type of material with a high amount of pseudocapacitance is electron-conducting polymers.

" Double-layer capacitance is the important characteristic of the electrical double layer which appears, for example, at the interface between a conductive electrode and an adjacent liquid electrolyte. At this boundary two layers of charge with opposing polarity form, one at the surface of the electrode, and one in the electrolyte. These two layers, electrons on the electrode and ions in the electrolyte, are typically separated by a single layer of solvent molecules that adhere to the surface of the electrode and act like a dielectric in a conventional capacitor.

"In general, the following conventions were used: This naming system can be confusing, as some entirely different vehicles used the same engine type and body style. Many Ferraris also had other names affixed (like Daytona) to identify them further. Many such names are actually not official factory names. The Daytona name commemorates Ferrari's triple success in the February 1967 24 Hours of Daytona with the 330 P4. Only in the 1973 Daytona 24 Hours, a 365 GTB/4 run by NART (who raced Ferraris in America) ran second, behind a Porsche 911.

"These are electrically connected via the electrolyte, a mixture of positive and negative ions dissolved in a solvent such as water. Where the liquid electrolyte contacts the electrode's conductive metallic surface, an interface is formed which represents a common boundary between the two phases of matter. It is at this interface that the double layer effect occurs. When a voltage is applied to the capacitor, two layers of polarized ions are generated at the electrode interfaces. One layer is within the solid electrode (at the surfaces of crystal grains from which it is made that are in contact with the electrolyte).
",991
"This is the area close to the IHP, in which the polarized electrolyte ions are collected. This separation of two layers of polarized ions through the double-layer stores electrical charges in the same way as in a conventional capacitor. The double-layer charge forms a static electric field in the molecular IHP layer of the solvent molecules that corresponds to the strength of the applied voltage.
",992
"The IHP's small thickness creates a strong electric field E over the separating solvent molecules. At a potential difference of, for example, U = 2 V and a molecular thickness of d = 0.4 nm, the electric field strength is To compare this figure with values from other capacitor types requires an estimation for electrolytic capacitors, the capacitors with the thinnest dielectric among conventional capacitors. The voltage proof of aluminum oxide, the dielectric layer of aluminum electrolytic capacitors, is approximately 1.4 nm/V.

"Using the early Helmholtz model to calculate the capacitance the model predicts a constant differential capacitance C independent from the charge density, even depending on the dielectric constant ε and the charge layer separation δ. If the electrolyte solvent is water then the influence of the high field strength creates a permittivity ε of 6 (instead of 80 without an applied electric field) and the layer separation δ ca. 0.3 nm, the Helmholtz model predicts a differential capacitance value of about 18 µF/cm.
",995
"This value can be used to calculate capacitance values using the standard formula for conventional plate capacitors if only the surface of the electrodes is known. This capacitance can be calculated with: The capacitance C is greatest in components made from materials with a high permittivity ε, large electrode plate surface areas A and a small distance d between plates.

"Because activated carbon electrodes have a very high surface area and an extremely thin double-layer distance which is on the order of a few ångströms (0.3-0.8 nm), it is understandable why supercapacitors have the highest capacitance values among the capacitors (in the range of 10 to 40 µF/cm). In real produced supercapacitors with a high amount of double-layer capacitance the capacitance value depends first on electrode surface and DL distance.

It is settled law that the process is based on the objective view of a reasonable person, given the context in which the contracting parties made their agreement. This approach marks a break with previous a more rigid modes of interpretation before the 1970s, where courts paid closer attention to the formal expression of the parties' intentions and took more of a literal view of what they had said. The process of interpretation was often skewed by courts who tried to construe contracts in a way that was fair.

"Before the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the courts had not developed a jurisdiction to strike down unfair terms. When faced with harsh exclusion clauses they would often ""interpret their way out"" of the plain meaning of the clause through a process of strict construction against the party relying on a clause (in Latin, ""contra proferentem"").

"Lord Hoffmann and the House of Lords unanimously accepted this interpretation, since it was the correct one given the context in which the contract was signed. One point of controversy was Lord Hoffmann's acceptance that the courts would not look at negotiations prior to the contract as an aid to interpretation. Professor G McMeel has argued that, ""The best way forward is for the matter to be one of weight rather than admissibility."" In other words, that evidence of negotiations may not necessarily weigh very heavily in the face of contradictory evidence in a contract itself, but it should not be barred entirely.

But with this triggering comes an opportunity to become free from it once and for all. The First Step, Wise Thinking, which you will learn about in the next chapter, shows you how to heal conditioning by questioning your old beliefs and stepping back into awareness.

"Asking a court to rectify a document does not mean asking for the contract to be changed. It just asks for the recording of the document to be changed. Rectification is an equitable discretionary remedy, and therefore unavailable to claimants who delay excessively and it has no effect against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. There is a fine line between interpretation and rectification, since evidence assisting in interpretation is also evidence which can give rise to rectification. Claimants can ask for both. But the order for rectification is rare. The reason for this is the necessity of promoting certainty.

"When you notice that you're eating to fill a psychological need, simply being aware of it can shift you back into the true self. _When you're able to notice your conditioning, you stop identifying with the ego and start identifying with the true self._ It's that simple. Noticing it is all it takes. Becoming aware of your conditioning opens up the possibility of another choice. Rather than following the well-worn path of emotional eating, you can choose _not_ to do that. You can ask yourself, ""Is this really what I want to be doing right now? Will it satisfy me forever?""

"In order to tackle the unfairness that can result from the use of exclusion clauses, courts have a variety of tools at their disposal. They can, But before 1977, legislation to directly regulate unfair terms did not exist, and jurisprudence on implied terms was underdeveloped. Even now, with one notable exception, the courts have not accepted that they have any inherent jurisdiction to control unfair terms. It is only under legislation that authority appears to exist. This meant that modes of interpretation were much more important to control unfair terms.

"They have left the job to Parliament. ""Contra proferentem"" means an exclusion clause is interpreted strictly against the party seeking to rely on it, so any ambiguity is resolved against them. As a mode of interpretation it is used particularly against exclusion clauses for negligence on the basis that the courts regard it as inherently unlikely that one party will agree to allow the other contracting party to exclude liability for his own negligence. However, since the enactment of UCTA 1977, the extent to which courts have employed the ""contra proferentem"" rule has waned.

"On one hand, it advocates excess and indulgence and on the other, rigid restriction or deprivation. Whenever eating results in suffering, we know we're in the ego. In contrast, the true self advocates balance, health, and temperance. It's quiet and doesn't fight for our attention, but nudges us and speaks to us through our intuition. For example, when we're grocery shopping, we may feel moved to buy something healthy that wasn't on our shopping list.

"The founders saw Doon as the training ground for a new generation of Indian leaders who would take over the reins of administration and government following Independence. By copying the model of the British public school, the founders were attempting to show that Indians could compete with the British on their own terms without relinquishing their national or cultural identity. This reflected the views of many Indian leaders and intellectuals of the time, but certainly not all. Characteristically, Jawaharlal Nehru welcomed the creation of the school but Mohandas K.

"It is ‘a question of construction of that clause in the context of the contract as a whole.’ Exclusions for negligence are contra proferentum, but a strained construction is no good, the ‘relevant words must be given, if possible, their natural, plain meaning.’ ‘Clauses of limitation are not regarded by the courts with the same hostility as clauses of exclusion: this is because they must be related to other contractual terms, in particular to the risks to which the defending party may be exposed, the remuneration which he receives, and possibly also the opportunity of the other party to insure.’ Lord Fraser, the Canada Steamship ‘principles are not applicable in their full rigour when considering the effect of clauses merely limiting liability.’ They are read contra proferentum and must be clear, but that is it.

"MSDP uses TCP as its transport protocol. Each multicast tree needs to have its own RP. All of the RPs are peers (directly or through other MSDP peers). Messages contain the sender (source) address and the multicast group address (S,G). If an RP on its own domain receives a message, it determines if there are listeners for this group. If listeners exist, it triggers a PIM join into the source domain towards the data source. In a peering relationship, one MSDP peer listens for new TCP connections on the well-known port 639.

"Stress is not distinctive in Swampy Cree. In other words, there are no minimal pairs of words that are distinguishable only by stress. Swampy Cree is a polysynthetic language that relies heavily on verbs so many things that would be expressed in English nouns or adjectives are expressed as verbs. In fact, Swampy Cree has no adjectives at all. Instead, it has the intransitive form of verbs. For example, instead of saying, ""He is strong,"" in Cree, one says something like ""He strongs.""
",1099
"Nouns in Swampy Cree have both free and bound stems, the latter being used in combination with other morphemes. Compounds are common and can be formed from other nouns, verb stems, and particles. Swampy Cree does not have gender in the Indo-European sense (masculine, feminine and neuter). Rather, it differentiates between animate and inanimate (see Animacy). While no living things are within the ""inanimate"" class, there are some nonliving things (socks, kettles, stones, paddles, etc.) within the ""animate"" class.

"The common FCC practice for station applications on the standard AM frequencies is to process the applications individually. For the expanded band, the Commission decided to allocate the entire band at once on a nationwide basis, after evaluating all of the stations which notified the FCC that they were interested in moving to the new band.

In such scenarios, scientists can share packages consisting of publication and supplementary material in an attempt to better deliver hypothesis and results of the research presented in the publication. This category of approaches focuses on enhanced publication data models whose parts, metadata and relationships are defined with the purpose of improving the end-user experience when visualizing and discovering research materials.

"There was an outstanding question about the number of stations, based on the proposed standards, that could be accommodated on the new frequencies, with the FCC noting that an engineering firm, Cohen, Dippell and Everist, had ""submitted an analysis to demonstrate that instead of 25 to 30 stations per channel... their calculations show 'approximately 5 (certainly less than 10)' stations can be assigned per channel"". In the fall of 1994, the FCC announced that, out of 688 applicants, a specially designed computer program (which took two weeks to run) had chosen 79 stations to make the transfer to the expanded band.

"However, a year later the Commission rescinded these assignments, after it was determined that there had been major flaws in the data used to evaluate the applications. A provision had been added to the Communications Act of 1934 in late 1991 which mandated that priority for expanded band assignments would be given to existing daytime-only stations that were located in a community with a population over 100,000, and which also did not have any full-time stations.

The existence of links between literature and data support the discovery of used and produced scientific data, strengthen data citation, facilitate data re-use, and reward the precious work underlying data management procedures.

"In addition to required separation standards, both within the United States and internationally, a major component of the evaluation was an individual station's ""interference improvement factor"", which was the degree to which a move to the expanded band would decrease the amount of interference on its vacated frequency, especially at night.

Health scares can be so traumatic that we do an about-face in our eating.

In certain circles the word is considered merely a common profanity with an often humorous connotation. For example, a person may be referred to as a 'fart', or an 'old fart', not necessarily depending on the person's age.

"'Fart' is often only used as a term of endearment when the subject is personally well known to the user. In both cases though, it tends to refer to personal habits or traits that the user considers to be a negative feature of the subject, even when it is a self-reference. For example, when concerned that a person is being overly methodical they might say 'I know I'm being an old fart', potentially to forestall negative thoughts and opinions in others.

"When used in an attempt to be offensive, the word is still considered vulgar, but it remains a mild example of such an insult. This usage dates back to the Medieval period, where the phrase 'not worth a fart' would be applied to an item held to be worthless. Whilst being accused of farting may be offensive, other phrasal descriptions of flatulent discharge, in phrases such as, ""Have you dropped your guts? "", ""Have you blown one off"" or ""Who shit?"" are certainly no less so.

In those moments, we forget who we are. In presuming that we are mere mortals whose happiness rests on pleasure seeking and desire fulfillment, we have no idea how short we sell ourselves.

" Source-specific multicast (SSM) is a method of delivering multicast packets in which the only packets that are delivered to a receiver are those originating from a specific source address requested by the receiver. By so limiting the source, SSM reduces demands on the network and improves security. SSM requires that the receiver specify the source address and explicitly excludes the use of the (*,G) join for all multicast groups in RFC 3376, which is possible only in IPv4's IGMPv3 and IPv6's MLDv2.

"In 1953, British Petroleum Company (BP) entered the Canadian market through the purchase of a minority stake in Calgary-based Triad Oil Company. In the early 1950s, the power struggle between oil companies and host governments in Middle East started, which hampered operations of British Petroleum in the region, and prompted it to diversify its operations beyond the heavily Middle East dependent oil production. The Canadian holding company of British Petroleum was renamed BP Canada in 1969; and in 1971, it acquired 97.8% stake of Supertest. Subsequently, Supertest was renamed to BP Canada Ltd, and other Canadian interests of British Petroleum were amalgamated to the new company.

"The combination of the resulting high cornering velocity and the tilting movement of the carriages helps ensure a comfortable ride for the passengers, although the jostle and sway compensating for track irregularities may cause ""travel sickness"" in those susceptible. The hydraulic tilting system is governed by two gyroscopes in the head cars. The curve is found on the base of the elevation of the external track. The use of this train did not require particular modifications to the existing rail network, but it is expensive in terms of maintenance of the rolling stock because of the complexity of the tilting system.

"It stops us from romanticizing food, which is crucial, because the moment we start fantasizing about how a food would look, smell, or taste, we create desire and desires demand fulfillment. For many of us, the pattern of indulging our food fantasies has become our default position. Once the fantasizing gains momentum, though, it's like trying to stop an oncoming freight train. There's almost no way to stop it once it gets rolling. Planning can help you jump-start pragmatic thinking and put the kibosh on these kinds of romantic food thoughts.

"Such smell can also be caused by the presence of large numbers of microflora bacteria or the presence of faeces in the rectum. Diets high in protein, especially sulfur-containing amino acids, have been demonstrated to significantly increase the smell of flatus. Normal flatus volume is 476 to 1491 mL per 24 hours. This variability between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly, the number of flatus episodes per day is variable; the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375 mL).
",1231
"The sound varies depending on the tightness of the sphincter muscle and velocity of the gas being propelled, as well as other factors, such as water and body fat. The auditory pitch (sound) of the flatulence outburst can also be affected by the anal embouchure.

"Other drugs including prokinetics, lubiprostone, antibiotics and probiotics are also used to treat bloating in patients with functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, and there is some evidence that these measures may reduce symptoms. A flexible tube, inserted into the rectum, can be used to collect intestinal gas in a flatus bag. This method is occasionally needed in a hospital setting, when the patient is unable to pass gas normally. One method of reducing the volume of flatus produced is dietary modification, reducing the amount of fermentable carbohydrates.

"Academic imperialism is blamed for ""tutelage, conformity, secondary role of dominated intellectuals and scholars, rationalization of the civilizing mission, and the inferior talent of scholars from the home country specializing in studies of the colony."" In the modern postcolonial era, academic imperialism has transformed itself into a more indirect form of control, based on Western monopoly on the flow of information in the world of academia. Syed Farid Alatas calls this ""academic neo-colonialism"". International academic imperialism generates academic dependency, or the dependency of non-Western scholars on Western academia.
",1235
"In non-Western countries, science is still dependent on institutions and ideas of Western science, which are often transplanted from Western countries. Syed Farid Alatas lists the following six aspects of academic dependency: Specific examples of academic dependency include the fact that most major journals are based in the Western countries and carry works by scholars located at Western universities; and that scholars in the Western countries study the entire world, whereas scholars in the non-Western countries focus on their own societies. Another example is the dominance of English language in the world of international academia.

"""L. acidophilus"" may make the intestinal environment more acidic, supporting a natural balance of the fermentative processes. ""L. acidophilus"" is available in supplements. Prebiotics, which generally are non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharide, generally increase flatulence in a similar way as described for lactose intolerance.

"Digestive enzyme supplements may significantly reduce the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus.

"In doctrine, Free Methodists’ beliefs are the standard beliefs of Wesleyan-Arminian Protestantism, with distinctive emphasis on the teaching of entire sanctification as held by John Wesley, to whom the Free Methodist Church traces its origins. The Free Methodist Church, along with the United Methodist Church, shares a common heritage linked to the Methodist revival in England during the 18th century. The Free Methodist Church itself arose within the context of holiness movement within 19th century Methodism. While some clergy in the Free Methodist Church wear the pulpit robe, others do not wear vestments of any sort during worship.

" Functional periodicity is a term that emerged around the late 19th century around the belief, later to be found invalid, that women suffered from physical and mental impairment during their menstrual cycle. Men held a higher status and were regarded as superior to women at this period in time. Many prominent male psychologists promoted the idea of functional periodicity. Women were not seen as being fit for certain types of work, responsibilities, and roles because of this idea. The idea of functional periodicity stems from ancient taboos and rituals that were passed on from generation to generation. It then developed into an actual theory in the twentieth century.
",1312
"Functional periodicity was investigated by a female psychologist named Leta Hollingworth. She made key contributions in the research of functional periodicity, as well as in the feminist movement at the time. Hollingworth, along with her husband Harry Hollingworth, established exceptional research on the idea of functional periodicity and created research studies investigating the science of motor/learning tasks involving the human body. Her research impacted how society viewed women, despite the patriarchal opinions held by many. Functional periodicity was the idea of women being functionally impaired during their menstruation cycle.

" Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling, is a scaling law based on a 1974 paper co-authored by Robert H. Dennard, after whom it is named. Originally formulated for MOSFETs, it states, roughly, that as transistors get smaller, their power density stays constant, so that the power use stays in proportion with area; both voltage and current scale (downward) with length. Dennard observes that transistor dimensions could be scaled by -30% (0.7x) every technology generation, thus reducing their area by 50%.
",1389
"This would reduce circuit delays by 30% (0.7x) and therefore increase operating frequency by about 40% (1.4x). Finally, to keep the electric field constant, voltage is reduced by 30%, reducing energy by 65% and power (at 1.4x frequency) by 50%. Therefore, in every technology generation, if the transistor density doubles, the circuit becomes 40% faster, and power consumption (with twice the number of transistors) stays the same. Moore's law says that the number of transistors doubles about every two years.

"By 1943, Room 61 on the top floor of the hall was being used for Radio fingerprinting (Ackbar 13). This new technology was employed to uniquely identify the particular wireless set that was being used to send the transmissions. Special receiving sets filmed the signals as they came in, like a cathode ray tube, and then the signals were captured on film and developed. Light tables were then used to compare the signals in order to verify who was sending them. A civilian from military intelligence at Bletchley Park was in charge of this room.
",1391
"Since around 2005–2007 Dennard scaling appears to have broken down. As of 2016, transistor counts in integrated circuits are still growing, but the resulting improvements in performance are more gradual than the speed-ups resulting from significant frequency increases. The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes, current leakage poses greater challenges and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore further increases energy costs. The breakdown of Dennard scaling and resulting inability to increase clock frequencies significantly has caused most CPU manufacturers to focus on multicore processors as an alternative way to improve performance.
",1392
"An increased core count benefits many (though by no means all) workloads, but the increase in active switching elements from having multiple cores still results in increased overall power consumption and thus worsens CPU power dissipation issues. The end result is that only some fraction of an integrated circuit can actually be active at any given point in time without violating power constraints. The remaining (inactive) area is referred to as dark silicon.

"Yet we witness that she cannot avoid violence, as it results from little more than promulgating ideas different from those held by the majority of those living within the current social structure, however disorganized and ungoverned that social structure may be. Butler posits that utopian society can never be achieved as an entity entirely separate from the outside world, one of the more commonly held beliefs about conditions necessary to achieve utopia.

"Furthermore, the court in ""R. (Giles) v.

Even though the application was ""strictly moot"", the House of Lords held that the application was ""rightly held to raise an important point of principle"". In summary, when an application no longer has any practical significance to the applicant after an important change in circumstances, English courts are generally reluctant to find that the applicant continues to have standing.

"Although this arguably rendered his challenge to the constitutionality of section 377A theoretical, the application was still of ""great practical significance"" to him. Given the applicant's sexual orientation, so long as the constitutionality of section 377A was not decisively settled, a similar act committed by him could possibly attract prosecution. Therefore, the applicant's personal rights were affected. Thus, there was no contradiction between the adoption of the English position and the third requirement of the ""Karaha Bodas"" test in ""Tan Eng Hong"".

" The Microsoft .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) is a version of the .NET Framework that is designed to run on resource constrained mobile/embedded devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, factory controllers, set-top boxes, etc. The .NET Compact Framework uses some of the same class libraries as the full .NET Framework and also a few libraries designed specifically for mobile devices such as .NET Compact Framework controls. However, the libraries are not exact copies of the .NET Framework; they are scaled down to use less space.
",1435
"It is possible to develop applications that use the .NET Compact Framework in Visual Studio .NET 2003, in Visual Studio 2005 and in Visual Studio 2008, in C# or Visual Basic .NET. Applications developed with Basic4ppc are also eventually compiled for the .NET CF. The resulting applications are designed to run on a special, mobile-device, high performance JIT compiler. The Microsoft .NET Compact Framework 3.5 Redistributable contains the common language runtime and class libraries built for the .NET Compact Framework.
",1436
"In addition to version 3.5 support, it also supports applications developed for version 1.0 and 2.0. The .NET Compact Framework 3.5 provides new features such as Windows Communication Foundation, LINQ, SoundPlayer, new runtime tool support, and many other features. The UI development is based on Windows Forms which is also available on the desktop version of the .NET Framework. User interfaces can easily be created with Visual Studio by placing .NET Compact Framework controls like buttons, text boxes, etc. on the forms. Also features like data binding are available for the .NET CF.
",1437
"A major disadvantage of the UI development is that modern looking applications with support for finger-based touch screen interaction are not that easy to implement. This is mainly due to the desktop-oriented user interface concept on which Windows Forms is based, although some third party libraries with custom controls for this purpose are available. To be able to run applications powered by the .NET Compact Framework, the platform must support the Microsoft .NET Compact Framework runtime. Some operating systems which do include .NET CF are Windows CE 4.1, Microsoft Pocket PC, Microsoft Pocket PC 2002, Smartphone 2003, and Symbian v3.

".NET Compact Framework applications can be run on desktop computers with the full .NET Framework as long as they only access the shared parts of both frameworks, though their user interface cannot be upgraded to look like that of an application developed for desktop PCs. A version of the .NET Compact Framework is also available for the Xbox 360 console. While it features the same runtime as the regular .NET CF, only a subset of the class library is available. This version is used by XNA Framework to run managed games on the console. There are other limitations as well, such as the number of threads being limited to 256.

"In this continual search for equality, many characters find themselves asking the same question: ""Is Gender Necessary"" (which is, coincidentally, one of Le Guin's novels and also another problem arising from gender biases). Robin Roberts, an American literary historian, addresses the link of these characters and what that means for our society today. Roberts believes that men and women would like to be equal, but are not equal. They should be fighting the same battle when in fact they are fighting each other. She also debates that gender equality has been a problem in every reach of feminism, not just in feminist science fiction.

"Gilarek outlines two approaches to social critique via Feminist SF: the use of fantastical elements such as ""invented worlds, planets, moons, and lands"", used to call attention to the ills of society by exaggerating them, or a more straightforward approach, ""relying on realist techniques to convey the message about the deficiencies of our world and its social organization, in particular the continued inequality of women"". There are many examples of redefined gender roles and gender identity found in Feminist SF, ranging from the inversion of gendered oppression to the amplification of gender stereotypes and tropes.

"Feminist science fiction offers authors the opportunity to imagine worlds and futures in which women are not bound by the standards, rules, and roles that exist in reality. Rather, the genre creates a space in which the gender binary might be troubled and different sexualities may be explored. As Anna Gilarek explains, issues of gender have been a part of feminist discourse throughout the feminist movement, and the work of authors such as Joanna Russ and Marge Piercy explore and expose gender based oppression.
",1442
"All of these authors demonstrate that science fiction criticism tackles the same questions as other literary criticism: race, gender, and the politics of Feminism itself. Wolf believes that evaluating primarily American texts, written over the past one hundred and twenty years, these critics locate science fiction's merits in its speculative possibilities. At the same time, however, all note that the texts they analyze reflect the issues and concerns of the historical period in which the literature was written. DeRose introduces her article with, in effect, the same argument. She says, ""the power of women in Science Fiction has greatly depreciated in the past few years"".

For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners. Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to restore and maintain contact with their families, is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate.

"The Court's analysis involved answering the following questions: The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court's textual interpretation of Article 49(1) because it failed to see how the presence of absence of the word ""an"" could resolve the questions. The Court believed that even if the word ""election"" was describing a process, this interpretation on its own would not answer the question of whether the Prime Minister had unfettered discretion.
",1445
"As such, the omission or inclusion of the word ""an"" did not add value to the understanding of Article 49(1), given that the phrase ""shall be filled by election"" was not any clearer than ""shall be filled by an election"" in determining the issue. Further, the phrase ""shall be filled by election"" is capable of being read in a ""double-barrelled sense"", meaning that it could in fact refer to both an event and process at the same time.

"Chlamydia, human papillomavirus (HPV), gonorrhea, herpes, hepatitis (multiple strains), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs) can be transmitted through oral sex. Any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.
",1452
"There is an increased risk of STI transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth, or bleeding gums. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth. These wounds, even when they are microscopic, increase the chances of contracting STIs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.

"However, the court's statement indicating it would only intervene in ""exceptional cases"" while taking a ""fact sensitive"" approach represents a reservation of a fair amount of leeway for the Prime Minister in making such decisions. It has also been noted that the Court of Appeal's approach to constitutional interpretation in the case reflects the approach taken by the Privy Council in ""Minister for Home Affairs v.

" A posted write is a computer bus write transaction that does not wait for a write completion response to indicate success or failure of the write transaction. For a posted write, the CPU assumes that the write cycle will complete with zero wait states, and so doesn't wait for the done. This speeds up writes considerably. For starters, it doesn't have to wait for the done response, but it also allows for better pipelining of the datapath without much performance penalty.

"A non-posted write requires that a bus transaction responds with a write completion response to indicate success or failure of the transaction, and is naturally much slower than a posted write since it requires a round trip delay similar to read bus transactions.

"Sometimes the region between two high pressure centers may also assume the character of a trough when there is a detectable wind shift noted at the surface. In the absence of a wind shift, the region is designated a col, akin to a geographic saddle between two mountain peaks. A trough is the result of the movements of the air in the atmosphere. In regions where there is upward movement near the ground and divergence at altitude, there is a loss of mass. The pressure becomes lower at this point.
",1473
"At upper levels of the atmosphere, this occurs when there is a meeting of a mass of cold air and another hot one along a thin ribbon called a frontal baroclinic zone. We then have the creation of a jet stream that plunges the cold air towards the equator and hot air towards the poles, creating a ripple in the circulation that is called a Rossby wave. These undulations give the hollows and peaks of altitude. In general, absolute vorticity advection is positive between these two features, but closer to the ridge, whereas it is negative just behind a trough.
",1474
"At the surface, lifting air under positive vorticity advection is reflected by the formation of depressions and troughs. There will therefore be a slope between the barometric high altitude and that on the ground, this slope going towards the mass of cold air at high altitude (generally towards the Pole). Troughs have an orientation relative to the poles which is rarely North-South. In the Northern Hemisphere, positively tilted troughs will extend from the lowest pressure northeast to southwest while negatively tilted troughs have a northwest to southeast orientation.

"Color-charged particles interact via gluon exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via photon exchange. However, gluons are themselves color-charged, resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color-charged particles are separated. Unlike the electromagnetic force, which diminishes as charged particles separate, color-charged particles feel increasing force. However, color-charged particles may combine to form color neutral composite particles called hadrons. A quark may pair up with an antiquark: the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor.

"The color and anticolor cancel out, forming a color neutral meson. Alternatively, three quarks can exist together, one quark being ""red"", another ""blue"", another ""green"". These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral baryon. Symmetrically, three antiquarks with the colors ""antired"", ""antiblue"" and ""antigreen"" can form a color-neutral antibaryon.

"Research into the properties of the newly discovered particle continues. The graviton is a hypothetical elementary spin-2 particle proposed to mediate gravitation. While it remains undiscovered due to the difficulty inherent in its detection, it is sometimes included in tables of elementary particles. The conventional graviton is massless, although there exist models containing massive Kaluza–Klein gravitons. Although experimental evidence overwhelmingly confirms the predictions derived from the Standard Model, some of its parameters were added arbitrarily, not determined by a particular explanation, which remain mysterious, for instance the hierarchy problem.
",1511
"Theories beyond the Standard Model attempt to resolve these shortcomings. One extension of the Standard Model attempts to combine the electroweak interaction with the strong interaction into a single 'grand unified theory' (GUT). Such a force would be spontaneously broken into the three forces by a Higgs-like mechanism. This breakdown is theorized to occur at high energies, making it difficult to observe unification in a laboratory. The most dramatic prediction of grand unification is the existence of X and Y bosons, which cause proton decay.
",1512
"However, the non-observation of proton decay at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory rules out the simplest GUTs, including SU(5) and SO(10). Supersymmetry extends the Standard Model by adding another class of symmetries to the Lagrangian. These symmetries exchange fermionic particles with bosonic ones. Such a symmetry predicts the existence of supersymmetric particles, abbreviated as ""sparticles"", which include the sleptons, squarks, neutralinos, and charginos.
",1513
"Each particle in the Standard Model would have a superpartner whose spin differs by from the ordinary particle.

The most fundamental of these are normally called preons, which is derived from ""pre-quarks"".

" In the philosophy of science, falsifiability or refutability is the capacity for a statement, theory or hypothesis to be contradicted by evidence. For example, the statement ""All swans are white"" is falsifiable because one can observe that black swans exist. Falsifiability was introduced by the philosopher of science Karl Popper in his book ""Logik der Forschung"" (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ""The Logic of Scientific Discovery""). He proposed it as the cornerstone of a solution to both the problem of induction and the problem of demarcation.
",1546
"Popper argued for falsifiability and opposed this to the intuitively similar concept of verifiability. Whereas verifying the claim ""All swans are white"" would require assessment of all swans, which is not possible, the single observation of a black swan is sufficient to falsify it. As a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent. One of the questions in scientific method is: how does one move from observations to scientific laws? This is the problem of induction.
",1547
"Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue (or ""induce"") from ""here is a white swan"" to ""all swans are white""; doing so would require a logical fallacy such as, for example, affirming the consequent. Popper's idea to solve this problem is that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ""not"" every swan is white.
",1548
"We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. Falsification uses the valid inference ""modus tollens"": if from a statement formula_1 (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce but what is observed is we infer that formula_1 is false.
",1549
"For example, given the statement ""all swans are white"" and the initial condition ""there is a swan here"", we can deduce ""the swan here is white"", but if what is observed is ""the swan here is not white"" (say black), then ""all swans are white"" is false, or it was not a swan. Popper's response to the problem of induction is simply that induction is actually never used in science. Instead, laws are conjectured, tested and the results are considered together with other aspects to decide which of these laws are applied in practice.
",1550
"In contrast, the logical empiricism movement, which included such philosophers as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath and A.J. Ayer wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that ""where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned"" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.
",1551
"Popper said that a demarcation criterion was possible, but we have to use the ""logical possibility"" of falsifications, which is falsifiability. He cited his encounter with psychoanalysis in the 1910s. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction.
",1552
"From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all. In the definition of falsifiability, contradictions with observations are not used for actual falsifications, but for ""logical"" ""falsifications"" that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different.
",1553
"On the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper said that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper said that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a criterion of demarcation. Any approach that relies on actual falsifications faces two challenges.

Long-term plans such as structuring public transportation, residential zones and recreational areas, are to be proposed by delegates and approved by direct democracy (i.e. voting by the population).

"In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous. Popper does not discuss corroborations when he describes the purely logical part. Popper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of verisimilitude, a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to describe a concept already clear in practice.

"Capitalism removes the knowledge of how and by whom a product was made: ""When we eat a salad the market systematically deletes information about the migrant workers who picked it"". By removing the human element from goods, consumers only consider their own satisfaction and need when consuming products. Introducing worker and consumer councils would reintroduce the knowledge of where, how and by whom products were manufactured. A participatory economy is expected to also introduce more socially oriented goods, such as parks, clean air, and public health care, through the interaction of the two councils.

"When this distinction is applied to the term ""falsifiability"", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term ""falsifiable"". Popper said that he only uses ""falsifiability"" or ""falsifiable"" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks instead of ""falsification"" and its problems. Popper said that methodological problems require proposing methodological rules.
",1563
"Popper distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories and accepted basic statements emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated. The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic. It is a delicate question, because this logic would be inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.

"If this leads to a world where human labour is no longer needed then our current market system models, which rely on scarcity, may have to adapt or fail. It is argued that this has been a factor in the creation of many of what David Graeber calls 'bullshit jobs', where, in large bureaucracies, production of anything is not the goal, but exist solely for reasons such as providing sociological benefit to the manager employing them. Post-capitalism is said to be possible due to major changes information technology has brought about in recent years.
",1565
"On the logical side, observations, which are purely logical constructions, do not show a law to be false, but contradict a law to show its falsifiability. Unlike falsifications and ""free from the problems of falsification"", these contradictions establish the value of the law, which may eventually be corroborated. He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood. In Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations. The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical basis.
",1566
"For example, in the law ""all swans are white"" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as ""there exists a black swan"" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, ""this swan here is black"" is a basic statement.
",1567
"Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements. Thornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular ""observation-reports"". He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability: As in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.

"Digital clutter is the term often used to describe the resulting (digital) artifacts of digital hoarding, but it should not be understood as exclusively the result of hoarding. Digital clutter can be created as a side-effect of high occurrences of another user activity, such as the computer desktop icons created through frequent installation of applications. In such a case the clutter does not reflect the user's intent to hoard.

"This may require using a deeper empirical basis, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ( gives some examples). Despite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science would not be possible. This article starts by stating that a falsifier must have parts that are separately technologically possible.
",1570
"Yet doesn't discuss multiple parts in a potential falsifier. This requires some explanation. In his analysis of the scientific nature of universal laws, Popper arrived at the conclusion that laws must ""allow us to deduce, roughly speaking, more ""empirical"" singular statements than we can deduce from the initial conditions alone."" A singular statement that has one part only can not contradict a universal law. It can only contradict a prediction that is obtained from the law together with another singular statement, the initial condition.
",1571
"A falsifier of a law has always two parts: the initial condition and the singular statement that contradicts the prediction. There was no need to require that falsifiers have two parts in the definition itself. This made the definition more general and allowed the basic statements themselves to be falsifiable.
",1572
"Criteria that require that a law must be predictive, just as is required by falsifiability, Popper wrote, ""have been put forward as criteria of the meaningfulness of sentences (rather than as criteria of demarcation applicable to theoretical systems) again and again after the publication of [his] book, even by critics who pooh-poohed [his] criterion of falsifiability.""

"In response to Lakatos who suggested that Newton's theory was as hard to show falsifiable as Freud's psychoanalytic theory, Popper gave the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another. It is clearly impossible, yet a basic statement that is a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. Another example of a basic statement is ""The inert mass of this object is ten times larger than its gravitational mass.""

" Laughter in animals other than humans describes animal behavior which resembles human laughter. Several non-human species demonstrate vocalizations that sound similar to human laughter. A significant proportion of these species are mammals, which suggests that the neurological functions occurred early in the process of mammalian evolution.

This behavior is documented in wild and captive chimpanzees.

"Electronic documents can become clutter if a user does not delete extraneous files, or if the files are poorly organized (e.g. inconsistent folder structure, empty folders). Some social media platforms also provide opportunity for digital hoarding. On the social networking site Facebook, for example, one can accumulate a vast number of “friends” that may merely be acquaintances or lapsed contacts or even complete strangers. Groups and Pages can also contribute to clutter when users join and like new ones, respectively, without leaving or unfollowing those in which they are no longer interested.

"Housekeeping is the term often used to refer to the activity by which digital clutter moves out of the 'clutter' designation, either by being thrown away, or by the recognition of its importance, thus no longer making it part of the 'clutter'. Digital hoarding occurs in any electronic spaces where information is stored. These are common areas where digital clutter may exist: A cluttered email inbox arises when a user does not have a system for archiving some messages and deleting others that are no longer wanted.

"More recent studies have investigated the emotional states of rats after being tickled. An animal's optimism or pessimism can be assessed by cognitive bias studies. After being tickled, rats are more optimistic, indicating the interaction invokes a positive affective state. Furthermore, rats self-administer playback of the 50-kHz trill calls and avoid playback of 22-kHz calls. When rats are given naloxone (an opioid antagonist), tickling no longer evokes the 50-kHz vocalisation which indicates that the rewarding properties of tickling are modulated by endogenous opioids.

"This program focused on digital hoarding, depicting Fisher's longstanding refusal to delete any digital content. Instead, Fisher purchased an additional computer every time he ran out of hard drive space. The BBC News story of Washington, D.C., resident Chris Yurista expresses a counterpoint to this perspective. The program portrayed Yurista as a ""21st century minimalist"" for living with hardly any physical assets, substituting digital goods wherever possible. Though digital hoarding is often given a negative connotation, some counter that it is not an unhealthy or detrimental practice.
",1579
"In addition, digital hoarding is clearly more benign than physical hoarding, which is more visible and takes up physical space. Finally, on a subjective level, digital hoarding can hardly be viewed as problematic if the consumer simply does not feel burdened by their collection of digital data.

"This is a basic statement because the inert mass and the gravitational mass can both be measured separately, even though it never happens that they are different. It is, as described by Popper, a valid falsifier for Einstein's equivalence principle. An example of a basic statement in the theory of evolution is ""In this industrial area, the relative fitness of the white-bodied peppered moth is high."" Here ""fitness"" means ""reproductive success over the next generation"".

"This ad hoc hypothesis introduced into young-Earth creationism makes it non-falsifiable because it says that the time of creation (of a species) measured by the accepted technology is illusory and no accepted technology is proposed to measure the claimed ""actual"" time of creation. Popper says that it's fine to modify a theory by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, but the new theory must at the least remain falsifiable, which is not the case here. One can also present the Omphalos hypothesis as an auxiliary hypothesis that is introduced into the accepted theory.

"For Popper, if no such a falsifiable law exists, then the metaphysical law is not useful, because it's not indirectly corroborated. Maxwell also used the example ""All solids have a melting point."" This is not falsifiable, because maybe the melting point will be reached at a higher temperature. The law is falsifiable and more useful if we specify an upper bound on melting points or a way to calculate this upper bound. Another example from Maxwell is ""All beta decays are accompanied with a neutrino emission from the same nucleus.""
",1584
"This is also not falsifiable, because maybe the neutrino can be detected in a different manner. The law is falsifiable and much more useful from a scientific point of view, if the method to detect the neutrino is specified. Maxwell said that most scientific laws are metaphysical statements of this kind, which, Popper said, need to be made more precise before they can be indirectly corroborated.

"Social hacking is most commonly associated as a component of “social engineering”. Although the practice involves exercising control over human behaviour rather than computers, the term ""social hacking"" is also used in reference to online behaviour and increasingly, social media activity. The technique can be used in multiple ways that affect public perception and conversely, increase public awareness of social hacking activity. However, while awareness helps reduce the volume of hacks being carried out, technology has allowed for attack tools to become more sophisticated. Carrying out a social hacking attack involves looking for weaknesses in user behaviour that can be exploited through seemingly legitimate means.

"But, for Popper and others, there is no (falsifiable) law of Natural Selection in this, because it only applies to some rare traits. Instead, for Popper, the work of Fisher and others on Natural Selection is part of an important metaphysical research program. Popper said that not all non-falsifiable statements are useless in science. Mathematical statements are good examples. Like all formal sciences, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the empirical world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as quantity, structure, space and change.

"Another advantageous find for social hackers is discarded hardware, especially hard drives that have not properly been scrubbed clean and still contain private and accurate information about corporations or individuals. Since surfing through people's curbside garbage is not a criminal offence and does not require a warrant, it is a rich resource for social hackers, as well as a legally accessible one. Dumpster diving can yield fruitful, albeit smelly results for information seekers such as private investigators, stalkers, nosy neighbours, and the police.

"They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ""determines"" the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper ""fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history"" and said that neither Marxism nor psychoanalysis was science, although both made such claims.

"Popper and others said that, if one uses the most widely accepted definition of ""fitness"" in modern biology (see subsection ), namely reproductive success itself, the expression ""survival of the fittest"" is a tautology. In practice, as illustrated by the peppered moth example of section , the questions asked are of the kind how specific traits affect the survival rate or fitness of a species when confronted by an environmental factor such as industrial pollution.

Later, it was revealed that the cyber criminals were able to access Target's financial and personal data files by targeting a third party mechanical company that had access to Target's network credentials. The social implications of such a high-profile social hack affect Target's popularity as a retailer, but also consumers’ trust and loyalty towards the brand.

"Although Target may not have been slacking in its security, the hackers were able to infiltrate Target's network indirectly, by identifying a third party company with by access to Target's credentials.

The need for vigilant online security is highlighted by cyber-attacks against corporations like Target as well as other global businesses and high-traffic websites. Even small websites are vulnerable to attacks, specifically because their security protection is presumed to be low.

"In this view, observation statements accumulate in a bucket through observations and various procedures are used to make sure that they are valid. Next, new laws are obtained in a way that can be ""justified"" using inference rules that are allowed to process all the knowledge that is available in the bucket. In this justificational picture, Hume said that we cannot obtain new universal laws (except what can be obtained through deductive rules). Hume's argument is based on reasonable premises: non-deductive rules are in need of justification, circular arguments are not valid, etc.

"If we accept Hume's premises, even probabilistic attempts to explain the growth of knowledge in terms of the bucket view of science, Popper stated, are doomed to fail. Popper's solution to this problem is simply to reject the bucket view of science. His main argument is basically that he accepts Hume's argument, which shows that the bucket view fails to explain the growth of objective knowledge. Popper said that the processes in the bucket are better seen as physical processes and the laws that govern these processes are biological.

It can also be used to counter negative feedback with an influx of positive responses (""like button"") e.g. on blog or news article comment sections. Social hacking can cause damage to the online profile of a person or a brand by the simple act of accessing information that is openly available through social media channels.

"If you want to believe that the methodology will work, it must be postulated as an axiom. In Popper's case, the axiom is that the methodology of conjectures and refutations is going to work. The conjectures are the searchlight, because they lead to observational results. But this axiom will not help any objective rule in the justification of scientific knowledge. There is no point in attempting any justification in the searchlight view. For a popperian, the absence of these objective rules is expected. It is not a failure.

"For example, advances in today's technology make it easier than ever to portray another person. This method is known as creating a ""deepfake"". A deep fake is where someone can recreate somebody else's face and voice with a computer program. It is used to fake people saying and doing things they have never done or said before.

"Back to the original question: why should falsifiability be the criterion? It is not that falsification directly leads to the rejection of a theory. That would be a rule of the bucket view of science. It is not that we must always look for theories that are more falsifiable. That would also be a rule of the bucket view of science. Popper's main methodological rule is that scientists must try to guess and corroborate (or equivalently falsify) bold and useful conjectures and take any falsification as a problem that can be used to start a critical discussion.

"Popper reemphasized non-justificationism, which was a good match for his added falsifiability criterion and associated critical methodology. As described in section , Lakatos and Popper agreed that universal laws cannot be logically deduced (except from laws that say even more), but he felt that, if the explanation for new laws can not be deductive, it must be inductive. He urged Popper explicitly to adopt some inductive principle and sets himself the task to find an inductive methodology. However, the methodology that he found did not offer any exact inductive rules.

"Deepfakes can be very dangerous in the sense that they can be used to fake what people with high authority have said such as, the president and politicians. There have been many articles and discussions over the new discovery of deepfakes such as Youtuber Shane Dawson's video, ""Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson"" where he talks about the conspiracy of deepfakes and what they could mean for the world today. Social hacking is also affiliated with social enterprise. Social enterprise can be represented in the form of for-profit or non-profit organizations that encourage socially responsible business strategies for long-term environmental and human well-being.

"Popper also offered a methodology with rules, but these rules are also not inductive rules, because they are not by themselves used to accept laws or establish their validity. They do that through the creativity or ""good judgment"" of the scientists only. For Popper, the required non deductive component of science never had to be an inductive methodology. He always viewed this component as a creative process beyond the explanatory reach of any rational methodology, but yet used to decide which theories should be studied and applied, find good problems and guess useful conjectures.

"Quoting Einstein to support his view, Popper said that this renders obsolete the need for an inductive methodology or logical path to the laws. For Popper, no inductive methodology was ever proposed to satisfactorily explain science. Section says that both Lakatos's and Popper's methodology are not inductive. Yet Lakatos's methodology extended importantly Popper's methodology: it added a historiographical component to it. This allowed Lakatos to find corroborations for his methodology in the history of science.

"The basic units in his methodology, which can be abandoned or pursued, are research programmes. Research programmes can be degenerative or progressive and only degenerative research programmes must be abandoned at some point. For Lakatos, this is mostly corroborated by facts in history. In contradistinction, Popper did not propose his methodology as a tool to reconstruct the history of science. Yet, some times, he did refer to history to corroborate his methodology. For example, he remarked that theories that were considered great successes were also the most likely to be falsified.

"In this line of thought, Einstein wrote that there is no logical path to science. Popper's scientific methodology that accompanies falsifiability contains rules such as ""He who decides one day that scientific statements do not call for any further test, and that they can be regarded as finally verified, retires from the game."" In general, the rules of Popper's methodology influence which theories will be chosen or rejected, but these rules do that only through decisions taken by the scientists. As described in , every rule to determine or choose theories must rely on the good judgement of the scientists.

"In the same line of thought, Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which represent some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section ). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles.

"In a response to Kuhn, Feyerabend and Musgrave, Lakatos acknowledged that the methodology depends on the good judgment of the scientists. Feyerabend wrote in ""Against Method"" that Lakatos' methodology of scientific research programmes is epistemological anarchism in disguise and Musgrave made a similar comment. In more recent work, Feyerabend says that Lakatos uses rules, but whether or not to follow any of these rules is left to the judgment of the scientists. This is also discussed elsewhere.

"This unfortunate occurrence occurs when animals consume grass at a faster rate than it can grow back. Lately overgrazing has become more apparent partially because of the increase in urbanization, which makes less room for available farmland. With these hence smaller plots, farmers try to maximize their space and profits by densely packing their land with animals. Another point that comes with the high density of owned animals is that farmers need to be able to provide for them in the winter months; so they must gather much grass, since the winter is often harsh and long in alpine meadows.

" First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, or to promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) while waiting for an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut. First aid is generally performed by someone with basic medical training.

"The origin of the ""feudum"" and why it replaced ""beneficium"" has not been well established, but there are multiple theories, described below. The most widely held theory was proposed by Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern in 1870, being supported by, amongst others, William Stubbs and Marc Bloch.

"These are examples; depending on the period of time and location in Europe, feudal customs and practices varied; see examples of feudalism. In its origin, the feudal grant of land had been seen in terms of a personal bond between lord and vassal, but with time and the transformation of fiefs into hereditary holdings, the nature of the system came to be seen as a form of ""politics of land"" (an expression used by the historian Marc Bloch).

"Thus, in some regions (like Normandy and Flanders), the vassal/feudal system was an effective tool for ducal and comital control, linking vassals to their lords; but in other regions, the system led to significant confusion, all the more so as vassals could and frequently did pledge themselves to two or more lords. In response to this, the idea of a ""liege lord"" was developed (where the obligations to one lord are regarded as superior) in the 12th century.

" Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is a disease prevalent in dogs that exhibit symptoms of dementia or Alzheimer's disease shown in humans. CCD creates pathological changes in the brain that slow the mental functioning of dogs resulting in loss of memory, motor function, and learned behaviors from training early in life. In the dog's brain, the protein beta-amyloid accumulates, creating protein deposits called plaques. As the dog ages, nerve cells die, and cerebrospinal fluid fills the empty space left by the dead nerve cells. Canine cognitive dysfunction takes effect in older dogs, mostly after 10 years of age.
",1674
"Although there is no known cause of CCD, genetic factors have been shown to contribute to the occurrence of this disease. Dogs with canine cognitive dysfunction may exhibit many symptoms associated with senile behavior and dementia. Dogs will often find themselves confused in familiar places of the home, spending long periods of time in one area of the home, not responding to calls or commands, and experiencing abnormal sleeping patterns. Although some of these symptoms may be attributed to old age itself, when they are exhibited together, there is a higher likelihood of CCD.

"Foxes are among the comparatively few mammals which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban (mostly suburban) human environments. Their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste, and their skittish and often nocturnal nature means that they are often able to avoid detection, despite their larger size. Urban foxes, however, have been identified as threats to cats and small dogs, and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environments.

"Foundationalism holds that there are 'basic beliefs' which serve as foundations to anchor the rest of our beliefs. Strong versions of the theory assert that an indirectly justified belief is completely justified by basic beliefs; more moderate theories hold that indirectly justified beliefs require basic beliefs to be justified, but can be further justified by other factors. During thousands of years, Western philosophy pursued a solid foundation as the ultimate and eternal reference system of knowledge called foundationalism. It has existed since ancient Greece, the focus of this theory is that all knowledge or cognitive awareness of the subject (human being) are based on a solid foundation.
",1685
"This foundation serves not only as the starting point merely as a basis for knowledge of the truth of existence. Thinking is the process of proving the validity of knowledge, not proving the rationality of the foundation from which knowledge is shaped. This means, with ultimate cause, the foundation is true, absolute, entire and impossible to prove. Neopragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty, a proponent of anti-foundationalism, said that the fundamentalism confirmed the existence of the ""privileged representation"" which constitutes the foundation, from which dominates epistemology. Plato's theory of Forms is the earliest foundationalism.
",1686
"So from the point of view of Plato, the Forms shows the general concept which plays as a model for the release of existence, which is only the faint copy of the Forms of eternity, that means, understanding the expression of objects leads to acquiring all knowledge, then acquiring knowledge accompanies achieving the truth. Achieving the truth means understanding the foundation. This idea still has some appeal in for example international relations studies.

"As an alternative to the classic view, modest foundationalism does not require that basic perceptual beliefs are infallible, but holds that it is reasonable to assume that perceptual beliefs are justified unless evidence to the contrary exists. This is still foundationalism because it maintains that all non-basic beliefs must be ultimately justified by basic beliefs, but it does not require that basic beliefs are infallible and allows inductive reasoning as an acceptable form of inference. For example, a belief that 'I see red' could be defeated with psychological evidence showing my mind to be confused or inattentive.
",1689
"Modest foundationalism can also be used to avoid the problem of inference. Even if perceptual beliefs are infallible, it is not clear that they can infallibly ground empirical knowledge (even if my belief that the table looks red to me is infallible, the inference to the belief that the table actually is red might not be infallible). Modest foundationalism does not require this link between perception and reality to be so strong; our perception of a table being yellow is adequate justification to believe that this is the case, even if it is not infallible.
",1690
"Goldman distinguished between two kinds of justification for beliefs: belief-dependent and belief-independent. A belief-dependent process uses prior beliefs to produce new beliefs; a belief-independent process does not, using other stimuli instead. Beliefs produced this way are justified because the processes that cause them are reliable; this might be because we have evolved to reach good conclusions when presented with sense-data, meaning the conclusions we draw from our senses are usually true.
",1691
"Even if one does not accept this very strong claim, foundationalists have a problem with giving an uncontroversial or principled account of which beliefs are self-evident or indubitable. Postmodernists and post-structuralists such as Richard Rorty and Jacques Derrida have attacked foundationalism on the grounds that the truth of a statement or discourse is only verifiable in accordance with other statements and discourses.
",1692
"Rorty in particular elaborates further on this, claiming that the individual, the community, the human body as a whole have a 'means by which they know the world' (this entails language, culture, semiotic systems, mathematics, science etc.). In order to verify particular means, or particular statements belonging to certain means (e.g., the propositions of the natural sciences), a person would have to 'step outside' the means and critique them neutrally, in order to provide a foundation for adopting them.

"Tradition is initially remembered behavior; once it loses its practical purpose, there is no reason for further transmission unless it has been imbued with meaning beyond the initial practicality of the action. This meaning is at the core of folkloristics, the study of folklore. With an increasingly theoretical sophistication of the social sciences, it has become evident that folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group; it is indeed all around us.
",1701
"That meaning can however shift and morph, for example: the Halloween celebration of the 21st century is not the All Hallows' Eve of the Middle Ages, and even gives rise to its own set of urban legends independent of the historical celebration; the cleansing rituals of Orthodox Judaism were originally good public health in a land with little water, but now these customs signify for some people identification as an Orthodox Jew. By comparison, a common action such as tooth brushing, which is also transmitted within a group, remains a practical hygiene and health issue and does not rise to the level of a group-defining tradition.

"This distinction aligned American folkloristics with cultural anthropology and ethnology, using the same techniques of data collection in their field research. This divided alliance of folkloristics between the humanities in Europe and the social sciences in America offers a wealth of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folkloristics as a whole, even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field itself. The term ""folkloristics"", along with the alternative name ""folklore studies"", became widely used in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the folklore artifacts themselves.

"Added to the extensive array of other legislation designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States, this law also marks a shift in national awareness. It gives voice to a growing understanding that cultural diversity is a national strength and a resource worthy of protection. Paradoxically, it is a unifying feature, not something that separates the citizens of a country. ""We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans"".

"Following the turbulent political, social and musical changes of the 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as ""rock and roll"", a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply ""rock music"", an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles were not part of mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.

"With the introduction of influences from electro music and funk, soul music became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a genre of music that was again called ""R&B"", usually distinguished from the earlier rhythm and blues by identifying it as ""contemporary R&B"". By the 1960s, the term ""rhythm and blues"" had no longer been in wide use; instead, terms like ""soul music"" were used to describe popular music by black artists.

Adding to the complexity of the interpretation, the birthday party for a seven-year-old will not be identical to the birthday party for that same child as a six-year-old, even though they follow the same model.

"Verbal lore is not just any conversation, but words and phrases conforming to a traditional configuration recognized by both the speaker and the audience. For narrative types by definition have consistent structure, and follow an existing model in their narrative form. As just one simple example, in English the phrase ""An elephant walks into a bar…"" instantaneously flags the following text as a joke. It might be one you've already heard, but it might be one that the speaker has just thought up within the current context.

"By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary. Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. This was later expanded into the Aarne–Thompson classification system by Stith Thompson and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature.
",1711
"As the number of classified oral artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items that had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs, giving rise to the Historic–Geographic Method, a methodology that dominated folkloristics in the first half of the 20th century. When William Thoms first published his appeal to document the verbal lore of the rural populations, it was believed these folk artifacts would die out as the population became literate. Over the past two centuries this belief has proven to be wrong; folklorists continue to collect verbal lore in both written and spoken form from all social groups.

"Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, while others performed fusions with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. Hip hop began to diversify in the latter part of the 1980s. New styles appeared, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul and Guru. The crews Public Enemy and N.W.A did the most during this era to bring hip hop to national attention; the former did so with incendiary and politically charged lyrics, while the latter became the first prominent example of gangsta rap.

"Some variants might have been captured in published collections, but much of it is still transmitted orally and indeed continues to be generated in new forms and variants at an alarming rate. Below is listed a small sampling of types and examples of verbal lore. The genre of material culture includes all artifacts that can be touched, held, lived in, or eaten. They are tangible objects with a physical presence, either intended for permanent use or to be used at the next meal.
",1715
"Folklorists are interested in the physical form, the method of manufacture or construction, the pattern of use, as well as the procurement of the raw materials. The meaning to those who both make and use these objects is important. Of primary significance in these studies is the complex balance of continuity over change in both their design and their decoration.

"Though the genre is considered to be rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands laid the groundwork for the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade. Heavy metal is a form of music characterized by aggressive, driving rhythms and highly amplified distorted guitars, generally with grandiose lyrics and virtuosic instrumentation.

"The assigned task of museums is to preserve and make use of these bulky artifacts of material culture. To this end, the concept of the living museum has developed, beginning in Scandinavia at the end of the 19th century. These open-air museums not only display the artifacts, but also teach visitors how the items were used, with actors reenacting the everyday lives of people from all segments of society, relying heavily on the material artifacts of a pre-industrial society. Many locations even duplicate the processing of the objects, thus creating new objects of an earlier historic time period.
",1719
"Living museums are now found throughout the world as part of a thriving heritage industry. This list represents just a small sampling of objects and skills that are included in studies of material culture. Customary culture is remembered enactment, i.e. re-enactment. It is the patterns of expected behavior within a group, the ""traditional and expected way of doing things"" A custom can be a single gesture, such as thumbs down or a handshake.

"This is as close as folklorists can come to observing the transmission and social function of this folk knowledge before the spread of literacy during the 19th century. As we have seen with the other genres, the original collections of children's lore and games in the 19th century was driven by a fear that the culture of childhood would die out. Early folklorists, among them Alice Gomme in Britain and William Wells Newell in the United States, felt a need to capture the unstructured and unsupervised street life and activities of children before it was lost. This fear proved to be unfounded.

"Another notable exponent is historian Guy Beiner who has presented in-depth studies of Irish folk history, identifying a number of characteristic genres for what he has named ""history telling"", such as stories (divided into tales and ""mini-histories""), songs and ballads (especially rebel songs), poems, rhymes, toasts, prophecies, proverbs and sayings, place-names, and a variety of commemorative ritual practices. These are often recited by dedicated storytellers (""seanchaithe"") and folk historians (""staireolaithe"").

"As organized entities of performance, items of folklore have a sense of control inherent in them, a power that can be capitalized upon and enhanced through effective performance."" Without transmission, these items are not folklore, they are just individual quirky tales and objects. This understanding in folkloristics only occurred in the second half of the 20th century, when the two terms ""folklore performance"" and ""text and context"" dominated discussions among folklorists. These terms are not contradictory or even mutually exclusive. As borrowings from other fields of study, one or the other linguistic formulation is more appropriate to any given discussion.
",1724
"Performance is frequently tied to verbal and customary lore, whereas context is used in discussions of material lore. Both formulations offer different perspectives on the same folkloric understanding, specifically that folklore artifacts need to remain embedded in their cultural environment if we are to gain insight into their meaning for the community. The concept of cultural (folklore) performance is shared with ethnography and anthropology among other social sciences. The cultural anthropologist Victor Turner identified four universal characteristics of cultural performance: playfulness, framing, the use of symbolic language, and employing the subjunctive mood.
",1725
"In viewing the performance, the audience leaves the daily reality to move into a mode of make-believe, or ""what if?"" It is self-evident that this fits well with all types of verbal lore, where reality has no place among the symbols, fantasies, and nonsense of traditional tales, proverbs, and jokes. Customs and the lore of children and games also fit easily into the language of a folklore performance. Material culture requires some moulding to turn it into a performance.
",1726
"Should we consider the performance of the creation of the artifact, as in a quilting party, or the performance of the recipients who use the quilt to cover their marriage bed? Here the language of context works better to describe the quilting of patterns copied from the grandmother, quilting as a social event during the winter months, or the gifting of a quilt to signify the importance of the event. Each of these—the traditional pattern chosen, the social event, and the gifting—occur within the broader context of the community.

"A public presentation in 1967 by Dan Ben-Amos at the American Folklore Society brought the behavioral approach into open debate among folklorists. In 1972 Richard Dorson called out the ""young Turks"" for their movement toward a behavioral approach to folklore. This approach ""shifted the conceptualization of folklore as an extractable item or 'text' to an emphasis on folklore as a kind of human behavior and communication. Conceptualizing folklore as behavior redefined the job of folklorists..."" Folklore became a verb, an action, something that people do, not just something that they have.
",1729
"It is in the performance and the active context that folklore artifacts get transmitted in informal, direct communication, either verbally or in demonstration. Performance includes all the different modes and manners in which this transmission occurs. Transmission is a communicative process requiring a binary: one individual or group who actively transmits information in some form to another individual or group. Each of these is a defined role in the folklore process. The tradition-bearer is the individual who actively passes along the knowledge of an artifact; this can be either a mother singing a lullaby to her baby, or an Irish dance troupe performing at a local festival.

"The performer is presenting to the audience; the audience in turn, through its actions and reactions, is actively communicating with the performer. The purpose of this performance is not to create something new but to re-create something that already exists; the performance is words and actions which are known, recognized and valued by both the performer and the audience. For folklore is first and foremost remembered behavior. As members of the same cultural reference group, they identify and value this performance as a piece of shared cultural knowledge. To initiate the performance, there must be a frame of some sort to indicate that what is to follow is indeed performance.

"This was one of the first records recorded for ""Oxymoron"". The song is a six-minute eerie, rattling song, produced by The Alchemist. The hook which includes the line, ""so now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind,"" sets the tone for the song as Schoolboy Q raps about how he's earned his living. He also counts the spoils of his most recent ""rap heist"". The production was described as, a ""jarring blend of droning piano and old-school, truck-rattling bass"" by Consequence of Sound.

"The frame brackets it as outside of normal discourse. In customary lore such as life cycle celebrations (ex. birthday) or dance performances, the framing occurs as part of the event, frequently marked by location. The audience goes to the event location to participate. Games are defined primarily by rules, it is with the initiation of the rules that the game is framed. The folklorist Barre Toelken describes an evening spent in a Navaho family playing string figure games, with each of the members shifting from performer to audience as they create and display different figures to each other.
",1734
"Many languages have similar phrases which are used to frame a traditional tale. Each of these linguistic formulas removes the bracketed text from ordinary discourse, and marks it as a recognized form of stylized, formulaic communication for both the performer and the audience. Framing as a narrative device serves to signal to both the story teller and the audience that the narrative which follows is indeed a fiction (verbal lore), and not to be understood as historical fact or reality.
",1735
"It moves the framed narration into the subjunctive mood, and marks a space in which ""fiction, history, story, tradition, art, teaching, all exist within the narrated or performed expressive 'event' outside the normal realms and constraints of reality or time."" This shift from the realis to the irrealis mood is understood by all participants within the reference group. It enables these fictional events to contain meaning for the group, and can lead to very real consequences.

"If this performance deviates too far from audience expectations of the familiar folk artifact, they will respond with negative feedback. Wanting to avoid more negative reaction, the performer will adjust his performance to conform to audience expectations. ""Social reward by an audience [is] a major factor in motivating narrators..."" It is this dynamic feedback loop between performer and audience which gives stability to the text of the performance. In reality, this model is not so simplistic; there is multiple redundancy in the active folklore process.
",1738
"The performer has heard the tale multiple times, he has heard it from different story tellers in multiple versions. In turn, he tells the tale multiple times to the same or a different audience, and they expect to hear the version they know. This expanded model of redundancy in a non-linear narrative process makes it difficult to innovate during any single performance; corrective feedback from the audience will be immediate.

"An agreement to return jurisdiction over the field workers to the farm union was reached on August 12, and FreshPict Foods (then owned by the Purex Corporation) and Inter-Harvest (part of the United Fruit Company) broke ranks with the other lettuce growers and signed contracts with the UFW. But the August 12 agreement collapsed, and 5,000–7,000 UFW workers struck the Salinas Valley growers on August 23 in what was the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history.

"The context is then unmasked by observation and questions concerning both its production and its usage. Why was it made, how was it made, who will use it, how will they use it, where did the raw materials come from, who designed it, etc. These questions are limited only by the skill of the interviewer. In his study of southeastern Kentucky chair makers, Michael Owen Jones describes production of a chair within the context of the life of the craftsman.

"""At the heart of both autopoetic self-maintenance and the 'virality' of meme transmission... it is enough to assume that some sort of recursive action maintains a degree of integrity [of the artifact] in certain features ... sufficient to allow us to recognize it as an instance of its type."" For material folk artifacts, it becomes more fruitful to return to the terminology of Alan Dundes: text and context. Here the text designates the physical artifact itself, the single item made by an individual for a specific purpose.
",1742
"Here the role of consumer ""... is the basic force responsible for the continuity and discontinuity of behavior."" In material culture the context becomes the cultural environment in which the object is made (chair), used (house), and sold (wares). None of these artisans is ""anonymous"" folk; they are individuals making a living with the tools and skills learned within and valued in the context of their community. No two performances are identical. The performer attempts to keep the performance within expectations, but this happens despite a multitude of changing variables.

"The folklorist Barre Toelken identifies this tension as ""... a combination of both changing (""dynamic"") and static (""conservative"") elements that evolve and change through sharing, communication and performance."" Over time, the cultural context shifts and morphs: new leaders, new technologies, new values, new awareness. As the context changes, so must the artifact, for without modifications to map existing artifacts into the evolving cultural landscape, they lose their meaning. Joking as an active form of verbal lore makes this tension visible as joke cycles come and go to reflect new issues of concern.
",1745
"Once an artifact is no longer applicable to the context, transmission becomes a nonstarter; it loses relevancy for a contemporary audience. If it is not transmitted, then it is no longer folklore and becomes instead an historic relic. It is too soon to identify how the advent of electronic communications will modify and change the performance and transmission of folklore artifacts. Just by looking at the development of one type of verbal lore, electronic joking, it is clear that the internet is modifying folkloric process, not killing it. Jokes and joking are as plentiful as ever both in traditional face-to-face interactions and through electronic transmission.

"New communication modes are also transforming traditional stories into many different configurations.

" In artificial intelligence, the frame problem describes an issue with using first-order logic (FOL) to express facts about a robot in the world. Representing the state of a robot with traditional FOL requires the use of many axioms that simply imply that things in the environment do not change arbitrarily. For example, Hayes describes a ""block world"" with rules about stacking blocks together. In a FOL system, additional axioms are required to make inferences about the environment (for example, that a block cannot change position unless it is physically moved).
",1752
"The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment. John McCarthy and Patrick J. Hayes defined this problem in their 1969 article, ""Some Philosophical Problems from the Standpoint of Artificial Intelligence"". In this paper, and many that came after, the formal mathematical problem was a starting point for more general discussions of the difficulty of knowledge representation for artificial intelligence. Issues such as how to provide rational default assumptions and what humans consider common sense in a virtual environment.
",1753
"Later, the term acquired a broader meaning in philosophy, where it is formulated as the problem of limiting the beliefs that have to be updated in response to actions. In the logical context, actions are typically specified by what they change, with the implicit assumption that everything else (the frame) remains unchanged. The frame problem occurs even in very simple domains. A scenario with a door, which can be open or closed, and a light, which can be on or off, is statically represented by two propositions formula_1 and formula_2.

President George W. Bush, in creating the National Clandestine Service (NCS), set a clear policy that the CIA would be in charge of all human intelligence (HUMINT) operations.
",1755
"In practice, one would have a predicate formula_9 for specifying when an action is executed and a rule formula_10 for specifying the effects of actions. The article on the situation calculus gives more details. While the three formulae above are a direct expression in logic of what is known, they do not suffice to correctly draw consequences. While the following conditions (representing the expected situation) are consistent with the three formulae above, they are not the only ones.
",1756
"If these conditions can change, they are better represented by two predicates formula_3 and formula_4 that depend on time; such predicates are called fluents. A domain in which the door is closed and the light off at time 0, and the door opened at time 1, can be directly represented in logic by the following formulae: The first two formulae represent the initial situation; the third formula represents the effect of executing the action of opening the door at time 1. If such an action had preconditions, such as the door being unlocked, it would have been represented by formula_8.
",1757
"For example, since the action executed at time 0 is that of opening the door, a frame axiom would state that the status of the light does not change from time 0 to time 1: The frame problem is that one such frame axiom is necessary for every pair of action and condition such that the action does not affect the condition. In other words, the problem is that of formalizing a dynamical domain without explicitly specifying the frame axioms. The solution proposed by McCarthy to solve this problem involves assuming that a minimal amount of condition changes have occurred; this solution is formalized using the framework of circumscription.
",1758
"The Yale shooting problem, however, shows that this solution is not always correct. Alternative solutions were then proposed, involving predicate completion, fluent occlusion, successor state axioms, etc. ; they are explained below. By the end of the 1980s, the frame problem as defined by McCarthy and Hayes was solved. Even after that, however, the term “frame problem” was still used, in part to refer to the same problem but under different settings (e.g., concurrent actions), and in part to refer to the general problem of representing and reasoning with dynamical domains.
",1759
"The following solutions depict how the frame problem is solved in various formalisms. The formalisms themselves are not presented in full: what is presented are simplified versions that are sufficient to explain the full solution. This solution was proposed by Erik Sandewall, who also defined a formal language for the specification of dynamical domains; therefore, such a domain can be first expressed in this language and then automatically translated into logic. In this article, only the expression in logic is shown, and only in the simplified language with no action names.
",1760
"The rationale of this solution is to represent not only the value of conditions over time, but also whether they can be affected by the last executed action. The latter is represented by another condition, called occlusion. A condition is said to be ""occluded"" in a given time point if an action has been just executed that makes the condition true or false as an effect. Occlusion can be viewed as “permission to change”: if a condition is occluded, it is relieved from obeying the constraint of inertia.
",1761
"In the simplified example of the door and the light, occlusion can be formalized by two predicates formula_12 and formula_13. The rationale is that a condition can change value only if the corresponding occlusion predicate is true at the next time point. In turn, the occlusion predicate is true only when an action affecting the condition is executed. In general, every action making a condition true or false also makes the corresponding occlusion predicate true.
",1762
"In this case, formula_19 is true, making the antecedent of the fourth formula above false for formula_20; therefore, the constraint that formula_21 does not hold for formula_20. Therefore, formula_1 can change value, which is also what is enforced by the third formula. In order for this condition to work, occlusion predicates have to be true only when they are made true as an effect of an action. This can be achieved either by circumscription or by predicate completion.
",1763
"The idea of such estimates is often credited to Sherman Kent, sometimes called the father of US intelligence analysis, with special emphasis on the production of estimates. This function is now in the National Intelligence Council of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Originally defined in 1950, this responsibility stated ""CIA is now in the business of producing what are called National Intelligence Estimates (NIE) along the lines laid down in NSC 50. These papers are interdepartmental in character, designed to focus all available intelligence on a problem of importance to the national security.""
",1764
"As a result, a predicate changes if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true. An action results in a change if and only if it makes true a condition that was previously false or vice versa. The third formula is a different way of saying that opening the door causes the door to be opened. Precisely, it states that opening the door changes the state of the door if it had been previously closed. The last two conditions state that a condition changes value at time formula_29 if and only if the corresponding change predicate is true at time formula_29.

In 1999, the CIA created the venture capital firm In-Q-Tel to help fund and develop technologies of interest to the agency.

"The fluent calculus is a variant of the situation calculus. It solves the frame problem by using first-order logic terms, rather than predicates, to represent the states. Converting predicates into terms in first-order logic is called reification; the fluent calculus can be seen as a logic in which predicates representing the state of conditions are reified.
",1768
"The difference between a predicate and a term in first-order logic is that a term is a representation of an object (possibly a complex object composed of other objects), while a predicate represents a condition that can be true or false when evaluated over a given set of terms. In the fluent calculus, each possible state is represented by a term obtained by composition of other terms, each one representing the conditions that are true in state. For example, the state in which the door is open and the light is on is represented by the term formula_45.
",1769
"It is important to notice that a term is not true or false by itself, as it is an object and not a condition. In other words, the term formula_45 represent a possible state, and does not by itself mean that this is the current state. A separate condition can be stated to specify that this is actually the state at a given time, e.g., formula_47 means that this is the state at time formula_48. The solution to the frame problem given in the fluent calculus is to specify the effects of actions by stating how a term representing the state changes when the action is executed.

"While the NCS organization chart has not been published, although there have been prior descriptions of the Directorate of Plans or the Directorate of Operations, a fairly recent organization chart of the Defense Clandestine Service will indicate functions transferred into the NCS, and may well be fairly close to the overall NCS organizational structure. The Special Activities Division (SAD) is a division of the Central Intelligence Agency's National Clandestine Service, responsible for covert action paramilitary operations, the collection of intelligence in hostile and/or denied areas and all high threat military and/or intelligence operations when the US government does not wish to be overtly associated with such activities.
",1771
"These Paramilitary Operations Officers were the spearhead of the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. There are references to earlier structures in various historical documents. For example, in a CIA paper on the internal probe into the Bay of Pigs Invasion, there are several comments on the Directorate of Plans organizational structure in 1962. Even though any large organization will constantly reorganize, the basic functions will stay and can be a clue to future organization. At the top level, Deputy Director for Plans Richard Bissell had two Assistant Deputy Directors, C. Tracy Barnes and Richard Helms.

"The frame problem can be thought of as the problem of formalizing the principle that, by default, ""everything is presumed to remain in the state in which it is"" (Leibniz, ""An Introduction to a Secret Encyclopædia"", ""c"". 1679).

"The fine tips enable access to individual contacts nodes of modern IC transistors. Navigation of the probe tips in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision piezoelectric manipulators.

"The counterpart of the default logic solution in the language of answer set programming is a rule with strong negation: (if formula_63 is true at time formula_64, and it can be assumed that formula_63 remains true at time formula_66, then we can conclude that formula_63 remains true). Separation logic is a formalism for reasoning about computer programs using pre/post specifications of the form formula_68.
",1775
"Separation logic is an extension of Hoare logic oriented to reasoning about mutable data structures in computer memory and other dynamic resources, and it has a special connective *, pronounced ""and separately"", to support independent reasoning about disjoint memory regions. Separation logic employs a ""tight"" interpretation of pre/post specs, which say that the code can ""only"" access memory locations guaranteed to exist by the precondition.

"Automation of the frame rule has led to significant increases in the scalability of automated reasoning techniques for code, eventually deployed industrially to codebases with 10s of millions of lines. There appears to be some similarity between the separation logic solution to the frame problem and that of the fluent calculus mentioned above. Action description languages elude the frame problem rather than solving it. An action description language is a formal language with a syntax that is specific for describing situations and actions.
",1778
"For example, that the action formula_71 makes the door open if not locked is expressed by: The semantics of an action description language depends on what the language can express (concurrent actions, delayed effects, etc.) and is usually based on transition systems. Since domains are expressed in these languages rather than directly in logic, the frame problem only arises when a specification given in an action description logic is to be translated into logic. Typically, however, a translation is given from these languages to answer set programming rather than first-order logic.

"As the CIA has no legal domestic police authority, it sends its analytic information to the FBI and other law enforcement organizations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

It receives the output of national technical means of verification and works with the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

"The event calculus uses terms for representing fluents, like the fluent calculus, but also has axioms constraining the value of fluents, like the successor state axioms. In the event calculus, inertia is enforced by formulae stating that a fluent is true if it has been true at a given previous time point and no action changing it to false has been performed in the meantime. Predicate completion is still needed in the event calculus for obtaining that a fluent is made true only if an action making it true has been performed, but also for obtaining that an action had been performed only if that is explicitly stated.
",1781
"This default, sometimes called the ""commonsense law of inertia"", was expressed by Raymond Reiter in default logic: (if formula_57 is true in situation formula_54, and it can be assumed that formula_57 remains true after executing action formula_60, then we can conclude that formula_57 remains true). Steve Hanks and Drew McDermott argued, on the basis of their Yale shooting example, that this solution to the frame problem is unsatisfactory. Hudson Turner showed, however, that it works correctly in the presence of appropriate additional postulates.

"Psychological stress is part of operations training, but of a different type than military special operations force evaluation, such as the Navy SEAL Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL course or Army Special Forces Assessment and Selection. For instance, an operations training officer will often lie to a recruit saying they have evidence that will result in the recruit to be arrested and tried for felony crimes. This is a test of the recruit's ability to maintain a cover under stress. These CIA Case Officers recruit foreign agents, known as 'assets', to give information to the CIA.

"To be classified as a distinct enzyme, ""direct experimental evidence is required that the proposed enzyme actually catalyses the reaction claimed"" Examples of unrelated enzymes with similar functions were noted as early as 1943 by Warburg and Christian (1943) who discovered two different forms of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, one occurring in yeast cells and the other occurring in rabbit muscle. In 1998 an article by Mariana Omelchenko et al, titled ""Analogous Enzymes: Independent Inventions in Enzyme Evolution"" identified 105 EC numbers containing two or more proteins without detectable sequence similarity to each other.
",1790
"A possible mechanism for the formation and evolution of these enzymes is recruitment of existing enzymes that gain new functions by a modification in substrate specificity (specifically at or near the active site) or modification of the existing catalytic mechanism. Discovery of NISE can reveal new mechanisms for enzyme catalysis and specific information about biochemical pathways that can be particularly important for drug development.

" Coherence in linguistics is what makes a text semantically meaningful. It is especially dealt with in text linguistics. Coherence is achieved through syntactical features such as the use of deictic, anaphoric and cataphoric elements or a logical tense structure, as well as presuppositions and implications connected to general world knowledge. The purely linguistic elements that make a text coherent are subsumed under the term cohesion.
",1792
"However, those text-based features which provide cohesion in a text do not necessarily help achieve coherence, that is, they do not always contribute to the meaningfulness of a text, be it written or spoken. It has been stated that a text coheres only if the world around is also coherent. Robert De Beaugrande and Wolfgang U. Dressler define coherence as a “continuity of senses” and “the mutual access and relevance within a configuration of concepts and relations”. Thereby a textual world is created that does not have to comply to the real world.
",1793
"Typical genome sequencing methods such as BLAST and the Hidden Markov model are used to find discrepancies and similarities in genomes.
",1794
"But within this textual world the arguments also have to be connected logically so that the reader/hearer can produce coherence. ""Continuity of senses"" implies a link between cohesion and the theory of Schemata initially proposed by F. C. Bartlett in 1932 which creates further implications for the notion of a ""text"". Schemata, subsequently distinguished into Formal and Content Schemata (in the field of TESOL) are the ways in which the world is organized in our minds. In other words, they are mental frameworks for the organization of information about the world.
",1795
"It can thus be assumed that a text is not always one because the existence of coherence is not always a given. On the contrary, coherence is relevant because of its dependence upon each individual's content and formal schemata.

"The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor. Movement of sperm is called sperm motility. The middle of the mammalian spermatozoon contains mitochondria that power the movement of the flagellum of the sperm. The motor around the base produces torque, just like in bacteria for movement through the aqueous environment. Movement using a pseudopod is accomplished through increases in pressure at one point on the cell membrane. This pressure increase is the result of actin polymerization between the cortex and the membrane.
",1806
"As the pressure increases the cell membrane is pushed outward creating the pseudopod. When the pseudopod moves outward, the rest of the body is pulled forward by cortical tension. The result is cell movement through the fluid medium. Furthermore, the direction of movement is determined by chemotaxis. When chemoattraction occurs in a particular area of the cell membrane, actin polymerization can begin and move the cell in that direction. An excellent example of an organism that utilizes pseudopods is ""Naegleria fowleri.""
",1807
"Since the Paleozoic, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity. The stop-start motion provided by the jets, however, continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators. Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates, and they can out accelerate most fish.
",1808
"The loss in efficiency is due to the amount of water the squid can accelerate out of its mantle cavity. Jellyfish use a one-way water cavity design which generates a phase of continuous cycles of jet-propulsion followed by a rest phase. The Froude efficiency is about 0.09, which indicates a very costly method of locomotion. The metabolic cost of transport for jellyfish is high when compared to a fish of equal mass. Other jet-propelled animals have similar problems in efficiency.
",1809
"Because of this, the negative pressure created by the vibrating cavity is lower than the positive pressure of the jet, meaning that inertial work of the mantle is small. Thus, jet-propulsion is shown as an inefficient swimming technique. Many fish swim through water by creating undulations with their bodies or oscillating their fins. The undulations create components of forward thrust complemented by a rearward force, side forces which are wasted portions of energy, and a normal force that is between the forward thrust and side force. Different fish swim by undulating different parts of their bodies.
",1810
"Streamlined shapes work to reduce drag by orienting elongated objects parallel to the force of drag, therefore allowing the current to pass over and taper off the end of the fish. This streamlined shape allows for more efficient use of energy locomotion. Some flat-shaped fish can take advantage of pressure drag by having a flat bottom surface and curved top surface. The pressure drag created allows for the upward lift of the fish. Appendages of aquatic organisms propel them in two main and biomechanically extreme mechanisms.
",1811
"Doves also appear as the form three princesses are cursed under by an evil magician, who also transformed a prince into a giant, in a Portuguese folktale. In a Basque tale collected by Wentworth Webster (""The Lady Pigeon and her Comb""), the destitute hero is instructed by a ""Tartaro"" to collect the pigeon garment of the middle maiden, instead of the youngest. Waldemar Kaden collected a tale from South Italy (German: ""Der geraubte Schleier""; English: ""The Stolen Veil""), although he does not credit the source.
",1812
"Their fur decreases streamlining and creates additional drag. The platypus may be a good example of an intermediate between drag and lift swimmers because it has been shown to have a rowing mechanism which is similar to lift-based pectoral oscillation. The limbs of semi-aquatic organisms are reserved for use on land and using them in water not only increases the cost of locomotion, but limits them to drag-based modes. Although they are less efficient, drag swimmers are able to produce more thrust at low speeds than lift swimmers. They are also thought to be better for maneuverability due to the large thrust produced.
",1813
"The corresponding tetrapod adult forms, even in the tail-retaining sub-class Urodeles, are sometimes aquatic to only a negligible extent (as in the genus Salamandra, whose tail has lost its suitability for aquatic propulsion), but the majority of Urodeles, from the newts to the giant salamander Megalobatrachus, retain a laterally compressed tail for a life that is aquatic to a considerable degree, which can use in a carangiform motion.
",1814
"Instead, Huck uses a white that he has in fact seen and experienced at first hand: ""There warn't no color in his face, where his face showed; it was white; not like another man's white, but a white to make a body sick, a white to make a body's flesh crawl — a tree-toad white, a fish-belly white"" (23). Note: According to The American College Heritage Dictionary, alabaster is ""A dense, translucent, white or tinted fine-grained gypsum [mineral]"" (31).
",1815
"Of the tailless amphibians (the frogs and toads of the sub-class Anura) the majority are aquatic to an insignificant extent in adult life, but in that considerable minority that are mainly aquatic we encounter for the first time the problem of adapting the tailless-tetrapod structure for aquatic propulsion. The mode that they use is unrelated to any used by fish. With their flexible back legs and webbed feet they execute something close to the leg movements of a human 'breast stroke,' rather more efficiently because the legs are better streamlined.
",1816
"Terrestrial snakes, in spite of their 'bad' hydromechanical shape with roughly circular cross-section and gradual posterior taper, swim fairly readily when required, by an anguilliform propulsion (see Fish locomotion#Anguilliform). Cheloniidae (true turtles) have found a beautiful solution to the problem of tetrapod swimming through the development of their forelimbs into flippers of high-aspect-ratio wing shape, with which they imitate a bird's propulsive mode more accurately than do the eagle-rays themselves.
",1817
"Some arthropods, such as lobsters and shrimps, can propel themselves backwards quickly by flicking their tail, known as lobstering or the caridoid escape reaction. Varieties of fish, such as teleosts, also use fast-starts to escape from predators. Fast-starts are characterized by the muscle contraction on one side of the fish twisting the fish into a C-shape. Afterwards, muscle contraction occurs on the opposite side to allow the fish to enter into a steady swimming state with waves of undulation traveling alongside the body.
",1818
"The power of the bending motion comes from fast-twitch muscle fibers located in the central region of the fish. The signal to perform this contraction comes from a set of Mauthner cells which simultaneously send a signal to the muscles on one side of the fish. Mauthner cells are activated when something startles the fish and can be activated by visual or sound-based stimuli. Fast-starts are split up into three stages. Stage one, which is called the preparatory stroke, is characterized by the initial bending to a C-shape with small delay caused by hydrodynamic resistance.
",1819
"Long, slender bodies reduce pressure drag by streamlining, while short, round bodies reduce frictional drag; therefore, the optimal shape of an organism depends on its niche. Swimming organisms with a fusiform shape are likely to experience the greatest reduction in both pressure and frictional drag. Wing shape also affects the amount of drag experienced by an organism, as with different methods of stroke, recovery of the pre-stroke position results in the accumulation of drag. High-speed ram ventilation creates laminar flow of water from the gills along the body of an organism.
",1820
"Some sharks' livers are composed of low-density lipids, such as hydrocarbon squalene or wax esters (also found in Myctophidae without swim bladders), which provide buoyancy. Swimming animals that are denser than water must generate lift or adapt a benthic lifestyle. Movement of the fish to generate hydrodynamic lift is necessary to prevent sinking. Often, their bodies act as hydrofoils, a task that is more effective in flat-bodied fish. At a small tilt angle, the lift is greater for flat fish than it is for fish with narrow bodies.

"It is proposed that lift may be physically generated at a lower energy cost by swimming upward and gliding downward, in a ""climb and glide"" motion, rather than constant swimming on a plane. Temperature can also greatly affect the ability of aquatic organisms to move through water. This is because temperature not only affects the properties of the water, but also the organisms in the water, as most have an ideal range specific to their body and metabolic needs. Q10 (temperature coefficient), the factor by which a rate increases at a 10 °C increase in temperature, is used to measure how organisms' performance relies on temperature.

We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight, sometimes, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves in daylight. What do we learn about the relationship between Huck and Jim during their visit to the floating house of death?

An exception occurs in case when the classical equations of motion are linear, that is, when formula_13 is quadratic and formula_8 is linear. In that special case, formula_15 and formula_16 do agree. Thus, for the case of a quantum harmonic oscillator, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.

"Suppose some system is presently in a quantum state . If we want to know the instantaneous time derivative of the expectation value of , that is, by definition where we are integrating over all of space. If we apply the Schrödinger equation, we find that By taking the complex conjugate we find Note , because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. Placing this into the above equation we have Often (but not always) the operator is time-independent so that its derivative is zero and we can ignore the last term. In the Heisenberg picture, the derivation is trivial.

"The Heisenberg picture moves the time dependence of the system to operators instead of state vectors. Starting with the Heisenberg equation of motion we can derive Ehrenfest's theorem simply by projecting the Heisenberg equation onto formula_26 from the right and formula_27 from the left, or taking the expectation value, so We can pull the out of the first term since the state vectors are no longer time dependent in the Heisenberg Picture. Therefore, The expectation values of the theorem, however, are the very same in the Schrödinger picture as well.

From these books, he gets an unRealistic view of the world. For example, he reads about Robin Hood, and he gets the idea that all robbers are honorable.

In the late 1950s and 1960s, an increasing number of published reports of barbiturate overdoses and dependence problems led physicians to reduce their prescription, particularly for spurious requests.

Peripherals included paper tape reader and punch, and a teleprinter. In 1967, six Zebra computers were in use in UK universities and technical colleges.

"Programming aids included the Normal Code (assembler), trace utility, a floating-point interpretive system, the Simple Code, the Matrix Interpretive Scheme, and an Algol compiler. Since a magnetic drum does not support random access, some time is lost waiting for an instruction or piece of data become available. In a poorly written program, the average wait time could be half the drum rotation time, but there were ways to reduce this.

"Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the ""Baconian method"", did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method. This method was a new rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology.

"Through this conclusion of particulars, an understanding of Nature can be formed. Now that an understanding of Nature has been arrived at, an inductive conclusion can be drawn. ""For no one successfully investigates the nature of a thing in the thing itself; the inquiry must be enlarged to things that have more in common with it."" Francis Bacon explains how we come to this understanding and knowledge because of this process in comprehending the complexities of nature. ""Bacon sees nature as an extremely subtle complexity, which affords all the energy of the natural philosopher to disclose her secrets.""
",1876
"Bacon described the evidence and proof revealed through taking a specific example from nature and expanding that example into a general, substantial claim of nature. Once we understand the particulars in nature, we can learn more about it and become surer of things occurring in nature, gaining knowledge and obtaining new information all the while. ""It is nothing less than a revival of Bacon’s supremely confident belief that inductive methods can provide us with ultimate and infallible answers concerning the laws and nature of the universe."" Bacon states that when we come to understand parts of nature, we can eventually understand nature better as a whole because of induction.

"Because of this, Bacon concludes that all learning and knowledge must be drawn from inductive reasoning. During the Restoration, Bacon was commonly invoked as a guiding spirit of the Royal Society founded under Charles II in 1660. During the 18th-century French Enlightenment, Bacon's non-metaphysical approach to science became more influential than the dualism of his French contemporary Descartes, and was associated with criticism of the ""ancien regime"". In 1733 Voltaire introduced him to a French audience as the ""father"" of the scientific method, an understanding which had become widespread by the 1750s.

"Although Bacon’s works are extremely instrumental, his argument falls short because observation and the scientific method are not completely necessary for everything. Bacon takes the inductive method too far, as seen through one of his aphorisms which says, ""Man, being the servant and interpreter of Nature, can do and understand so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature: Beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything."" As humans, we are capable of more than pure observation and can use deduction to form theories.
",1881
"In fact, we must use deduction because Bacon’s pure inductive method is incomplete. Thus, it is not Bacon’s ideas alone that form the scientific method we use today. If that were the case, we would not be able to fully understand the observations we make and deduce new theories. Author Ernst Mayr states, ""Inductivism had a great vogue in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, but it is now clear that a purely inductive approach is quite sterile."" Mayr points out that an inductive approach on its own just doesn’t work.

"One could observe an experiment multiple times, but still be unable to make generalizations and correctly understand the knowledge. Bacon’s inductive method is beneficial, but incomplete and leaves gaps. However, when combined with the ideas of Descartes, the gaps are filled in Bacon’s inductive method. The ""anticipation of nature"" as Bacon puts it, connects the information gained from observation, enabling hypotheses and theories to become more effective. Bacon’s inductive ideas now have more value.
",1883
"Jurgen Klein, who researched Bacon and analyzed his works, says, ""The inductive method helps the human mind to find a way to ascertain truthful knowledge."" Klein shows the value that Bacon’s method truly brings. It is not a value that stands on its own, for it has holes, but it is a value that supports and strengthens. The inductive method can be seen as a tool used alongside other ideas, such as deduction, which now creates a method which is most effective and used today: the scientific method.
",1884
"The inductive method is more prominent in the scientific method than other ideas, which leads to misconception, but the takeaway is that it has supporting ideas. Francis Bacon’s scientific method is extremely influential, but has been developed for its own good, as all great ideas are. Bacon played a leading role in establishing the British colonies in North America, especially in Virginia, the Carolinas and Newfoundland in northeastern Canada.

"For Bacon, torture was not a punitive measure, an intended form of state repression, but instead offered a modus operandi for the government agent tasked with uncovering acts of treason. Francis Bacon developed the idea that a classification of knowledge must be universal while handling all possible resources. In his progressive view, humanity would be better if the access to educational resources were provided to the public, hence the need to organise it. His approach to learning reshaped the Western view of knowledge theory from an individual to a social interest.
",1889
"The original classification proposed by Bacon organised all types of knowledge in three general groups: history, poetry, and philosophy. He did that based on his understanding of how information is processed: memory, imagination, and reason, respectively. His methodical approach to the categorization of knowledge goes hand-in-hand with his principles of scientific methods.

She argues that Bacon's movement for the advancement of learning was closely connected with the German Rosicrucian movement, while Bacon's ""New Atlantis"" portrays a land ruled by Rosicrucians.

Such processing is analogous to servicing people in a queue area on a first-come, first-served basis, in the same sequence in which they had arrived at the queue's tail.
",1900
"FCFS is also the jargon term for the FIFO operating system scheduling algorithm, which gives every process central processing unit (CPU) time in the order in which it is demanded. FIFO's opposite is LIFO, last-in-first-out, where the youngest entry or 'top of the stack' is processed first. A priority queue is neither FIFO or LIFO but may adopt similar behaviour temporarily or by default. Queueing theory encompasses these methods for processing data structures, as well as interactions between strict-FIFO queues.
",1901
"Depending on the application, a FIFO could be implemented as a hardware shift register, or using different memory structures, typically a circular buffer or a kind of list. For information on the abstract data structure, see Queue (data structure). Most software implementations of a FIFO queue are not thread safe and require a locking mechanism to verify the data structure chain is being manipulated by only one thread at a time. The following code shows a linked list FIFO C++ language implementation.
",1902
"In practice, a number of list implementations exist, including popular Unix systems C sys/queue.h macros or the C++ standard library std::list template, avoiding the need for implementing the data structure from scratch. using namespace std; template <typename T> class FIFO { public: }; The ends of a FIFO queue are often referred to as ""head"" and ""tail"". Unfortunately, a controversy exists regarding those terms: In computing environments that support the pipes and filters model for interprocess communication, a FIFO is another name for a named pipe.
",1903
"Disk controllers can use the FIFO as a disk scheduling algorithm to determine the order in which to service disk I/O requests. Communication network bridges, switches and routers used in computer networks use FIFOs to hold data packets en route to their next destination. Typically at least one FIFO structure is used per network connection. Some devices feature multiple FIFOs for simultaneously and independently queuing different types of information. FIFOs are commonly used in electronic circuits for buffering and flow control between hardware and software.
",1904
"In its hardware form, a FIFO primarily consists of a set of read and write pointers, storage and control logic. Storage may be static random access memory (SRAM), flip-flops, latches or any other suitable form of storage. For FIFOs of non-trivial size, a dual-port SRAM is usually used, where one port is dedicated to writing and the other to reading. A synchronous FIFO is a FIFO where the same clock is used for both reading and writing. An asynchronous FIFO uses different clocks for reading and writing.
",1905
"Asynchronous FIFOs introduce metastability issues. A common implementation of an asynchronous FIFO uses a Gray code (or any unit distance code) for the read and write pointers to ensure reliable flag generation. One further note concerning flag generation is that one must necessarily use pointer arithmetic to generate flags for asynchronous FIFO implementations. Conversely, one may use either a ""leaky bucket"" approach or pointer arithmetic to generate flags in synchronous FIFO implementations. Examples of FIFO status flags include: full, empty, almost full, almost empty, etc.
",1906
"The first known FIFO implemented in electronics was done by Peter Alfke in 1969 at Fairchild Semiconductors . Peter Alfke was later a director at Xilinx. A hardware FIFO is used for synchronization purposes. It is often implemented as a circular queue, and thus has two pointers: Read and write addresses are initially both at the first memory location and the FIFO queue is ""empty"". In both cases, the read and write addresses end up being equal.
",1907
"To distinguish between the two situations, a simple and robust solution is to add one extra bit for each read and write address which is inverted each time the address wraps. With this set up, the disambiguation conditions are:

Following the defeat of TriMet's South–North Line in a regional ballot measure on November 3, 1998, the Portland Development Commission allotted $7.5 million in tax increment funds from the South Park Blocks urban renewal area. They were used to extend the streetcar route through the PSU Campus to Southwest 5th Avenue.

"The firewall serves as a fire containment wall between one oil-filled transformer and other neighboring transformers, building structures, and site equipment. There are three main classifications of ""fire rated walls"": fire walls, fire barriers, and fire partitions. To the layperson, the common use of language typically includes all three when referring to a ""firewall"" unless distinguishing between them becomes necessary. In addition specialty fire-rated walls such as a High Challenge Fire Wall would require further distinctions.

"For example, a firewall designed to meet National Fire Protection Agency, (NFPA), 221-09 section A.5.7 which indicates an average temperature of , is not designed to withstand higher temperatures such as would be present in higher challenge fires, and as a result would fail to function for the expected duration of the listed wall rating. Performance based design takes into account the potential conditions during a fire. Understanding thermal limitations of materials is essential to using the correct material for the application. Laboratory testing is used to simulate fire scenarios and wall loading conditions.
",1913
"The testing results in an assigned listing number for the fire-rated assembly that defines the expected fire resistance duration and wall structural integrity under the tested conditions. Designers may elect to specify a listed fire wall assembly or design a wall system that would require performance testing to certify the expected protections before use of the designed fire-rated wall system. Firewalls are also regularly found in aircraft and in specially prepared cars for compartmentalisation and competition use. For example, a typical conversion of a production car for rallying will include a metal firewall which seals the fuel tank off from the interior of the vehicle.
",1914
"In the event of an accident, resulting in fuel spillage, the firewall can prevent burning fuel from entering the passenger compartment, where it could cause serious injury or death. In regular stock cars, the firewall separates the engine compartment from the cabin and can, at times, contain fibreglass insulation. Automotive firewalls have to be fitted so that they form a complete seal. Usually this is done by bonding the sheet metal to the bodywork using fibreglass resin. The term firewall is also commonly used in American English to refer to the barrier between the passenger and engine compartments of a vehicle.

" A fourth-generation programming language (4GL) is any computer programming language that belongs to a class of languages envisioned as an advancement upon third-generation programming languages (3GL). Each of the programming language generations aims to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details, making the language more programmer-friendly, powerful, and versatile. While the definition of 4GL has changed over time, it can be typified by operating more with large collections of information at once rather than focusing on just bits and bytes.

"Languages claimed to be 4GL may include support for database management, report generation, mathematical optimization, GUI development, or web development. Some researchers state that 4GLs are a subset of domain-specific languages. The concept of 4GL was developed from the 1970s through the 1990s, overlapping most of the development of 3GL, with 4GLs identified as ""non-procedural"" or ""program-generating"" languages, contrasted with 3GLs being algorithmic or procedural languages.

Some advanced 3GLs like Python, Ruby, and Perl combine some 4GL abilities within a general-purpose 3GL environment, and libraries with 4GL-like features have been developed as add-ons for most popular 3GLs, producing languages that are a mix of 3GL and 4GL, blurring the distinction.

"The term can apply to a large set of software products. It can also apply to an approach that looks for greater semantic properties and implementation power. Just as the 3GL offered greater power to the programmer, so too did the 4GL open up the development environment to a wider population. The early input scheme for the 4GL supported entry of data within the 72-character limit of the punched card (8 bytes used for sequencing) where a card's tag would identify the type or function.
",1941
"With judicious use of a few cards, the 4GL deck could offer a wide variety of processing and reporting capability whereas the equivalent functionality coded in a 3GL could subsume, perhaps, a whole box or more of cards. The 72-character format continued for a while as hardware progressed to larger memory and terminal interfaces. Even with its limitations, this approach supported highly sophisticated applications. As interfaces improved and allowed longer statement lengths and grammar-driven input handling, greater power ensued. An example of this is described on the Nomad page.

"The development of the 4GL was influenced by several factors, with the hardware and operating system constraints having a large weight. When the 4GL was first introduced, a disparate mix of hardware and operating systems mandated custom application development support that was specific to the system in order to ensure sales. One example is the MAPPER system developed by Sperry. Though it has roots back to the beginning, the system has proven successful in many applications and has been ported to modern platforms. The latest variant is embedded in the BIS offering of Unisys. MARK-IV is now known as VISION:BUILDER and is offered by Computer Associates.

" Aerosol Impaction is the process in which particles are removed from an air stream by forcing the gases to make a sharp bend. Particles above a certain size possess so much momentum that they can not follow the air stream and strike a collection surface which is available for later analysis of mass and composition. Removal of particles from an air-stream by impaction followed by mass and composition analysis has always been a different approach as to filter sampling, yet has been little utilized for routine analysis because of lack of suitable analytical methods.
",1986
"The most clear and important advantage of impaction, as opposed to filtration, is that two key aerosol parameters, size and composition, can be simultaneously established. There are many advantages of impaction as a sampling method. For two of the most common configurations, an orifice and an infinite slot, theoretical predictions can be made and empirically verified that give the cuts point and shape of the collection efficiency of an impaction stage. The air stream moves over the sample, not through it as in filtration, reducing desiccation and chemical transformations of the collected sample.

"Almost complete control of the type of surface on which the particles are impacted, as opposed to the limited choice of filter types. By varying the speed of the air stream and the sharpness of the bend, one can separate particles into numerous size classifications while retaining a sample for analysis. There are also several disadvantages to impaction as a sampling method. Only a limited amount of material is available for mass and compositional analysis, as one can not collect more than a few monolayers of particles before particle bounce and mis-sizing are a potential problem.

" In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen.
",1999
"This position is indicated as the exponent component, and thus the floating-point representation can be thought of as a kind of scientific notation. A floating-point system can be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of different orders of magnitude: e.g. the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same unit of length. The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers varies with the chosen scale. Over the years, a variety of floating-point representations have been used in computers.

"In 1985, the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic was established, and since the 1990s, the most commonly encountered representations are those defined by the IEEE.

However, 1/3 cannot be represented exactly by either binary (0.010101...) or decimal (0.333...), but in base 3, it is trivial (0.1 or 1×3) .

ACSSB also offers reduced bandwidth and improved range for a given power level compared with narrow band FM modulation.

"Five of these formats are called ""basic formats"", and others are termed ""extended precision formats"" and ""extendable precision format"". Three formats are especially widely used in computer hardware and languages: Increasing the precision of the floating-point representation generally reduces the amount of accumulated round-off error caused by intermediate calculations. Less common IEEE formats include: Any integer with absolute value less than 2 can be exactly represented in the single precision format, and any integer with absolute value less than 2 can be exactly represented in the double precision format. Furthermore, a wide range of powers of 2 times such a number can be represented.

"These properties are sometimes used for purely integer data, to get 53-bit integers on platforms that have double precision floats but only 32-bit integers. The standard specifies some special values, and their representation: positive infinity (+∞), negative infinity (−∞), a negative zero (−0) distinct from ordinary (""positive"") zero, and ""not a number"" values (NaNs).

By their nature, all numbers expressed in floating-point format are rational numbers with a terminating expansion in the relevant base (for example, a terminating decimal expansion in base-10, or a terminating binary expansion in base-2). Irrational numbers, such as π or √2, or non-terminating rational numbers, must be approximated. The number of digits (or bits) of precision also limits the set of rational numbers that can be represented exactly.

"If there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value. The representation chosen will have a different value from the original, and the value thus adjusted is called the ""rounded value"". Whether or not a rational number has a terminating expansion depends on the base. For example, in base-10 the number 1/2 has a terminating expansion (0.5) while the number 1/3 does not (0.333...).

"IEEE 754 requires ""correct rounding"": that is, the rounded result is as if infinitely precise arithmetic was used to compute the value and then rounded (although in implementation only three extra bits are needed to ensure this). There are several different rounding schemes (or ""rounding modes""). Historically, truncation was the typical approach. Since the introduction of IEEE 754, the default method (""round to nearest, ties to even"", sometimes called Banker's Rounding) is more commonly used.
",2039
"This method rounds the ideal (infinitely precise) result of an arithmetic operation to the nearest representable value, and gives that representation as the result. In the case of a tie, the value that would make the significand end in an even digit is chosen. The IEEE 754 standard requires the same rounding to be applied to all fundamental algebraic operations, including square root and conversions, when there is a numeric (non-NaN) result. It means that the results of IEEE 754 operations are completely determined in all bits of the result, except for the representation of NaNs.
",2040
"(""Library"" functions such as cosine and log are not mandated.) Alternative rounding options are also available. IEEE 754 specifies the following rounding modes: Alternative modes are useful when the amount of error being introduced must be bounded. Applications that require a bounded error are multi-precision floating-point, and interval arithmetic. The alternative rounding modes are also useful in diagnosing numerical instability: if the results of a subroutine vary substantially between rounding to + and − infinity then it is likely numerically unstable and affected by round-off error.

For ease of presentation and understanding, decimal radix with 7 digit precision will be used in the examples, as in the IEEE 754 ""decimal32"" format.

"The fundamental principles are the same in any radix or precision, except that normalization is optional (it does not affect the numerical value of the result). Here, ""s"" denotes the significand and ""e"" denotes the exponent. A simple method to add floating-point numbers is to first represent them with the same exponent. In the example below, the second number is shifted right by three digits, and one then proceeds with the usual addition method: In detail: This is the true result, the exact sum of the operands. It will be rounded to seven digits and then normalized if necessary.

"The final result is The lowest three digits of the second operand (654) are essentially lost. This is round-off error. In extreme cases, the sum of two non-zero numbers may be equal to one of them: In the above conceptual examples it would appear that a large number of extra digits would need to be provided by the adder to ensure correct rounding; however, for binary addition or subtraction using careful implementation techniques only two extra ""guard"" bits and one extra ""sticky"" bit need to be carried beyond the precision of the operands.

The mandated behavior of IEEE-compliant hardware is that the result be within one-half of a ULP. Rounding is used when the exact result of a floating-point operation (or a conversion to floating-point format) would need more digits than there are digits in the significand.
",2045
"In extreme cases, all significant digits of precision can be lost (although gradual underflow ensures that the result will not be zero unless the two operands were equal). This ""cancellation"" illustrates the danger in assuming that all of the digits of a computed result are meaningful. Dealing with the consequences of these errors is a topic in numerical analysis; see also Accuracy problems. To multiply, the significands are multiplied while the exponents are added, and the result is rounded and normalized.

"Similarly, division is accomplished by subtracting the divisor's exponent from the dividend's exponent, and dividing the dividend's significand by the divisor's significand. There are no cancellation or absorption problems with multiplication or division, though small errors may accumulate as operations are performed in succession. In practice, the way these operations are carried out in digital logic can be quite complex (see Booth's multiplication algorithm and Division algorithm). For a fast, simple method, see the Horner method.

Here, the required default method of handling exceptions according to IEEE 754 is discussed (the IEEE 754 optional trapping and other ""alternate exception handling"" modes are not discussed).

"Floating-point computation in a computer can run into three kinds of problems: Prior to the IEEE standard, such conditions usually caused the program to terminate, or triggered some kind of trap that the programmer might be able to catch.

"For instance, 1/0 returns +∞, while also setting the divide-by-zero flag bit (this default of ∞ is designed to often return a finite result when used in subsequent operations and so be safely ignored). The original IEEE 754 standard, however, failed to recommend operations to handle such sets of arithmetic exception flag bits. So while these were implemented in hardware, initially programming language implementations typically did not provide a means to access them (apart from assembler).

"Over time some programming language standards (e.g., C99/C11 and Fortran) have been updated to specify methods to access and change status flag bits. The 2008 version of the IEEE 754 standard now specifies a few operations for accessing and handling the arithmetic flag bits. The programming model is based on a single thread of execution and use of them by multiple threads has to be handled by a means outside of the standard (e.g. C11 specifies that the flags have thread-local storage).

"The basic approach is to show that although the calculated result, due to roundoff errors, will not be exactly correct, it is the exact solution to a nearby problem with slightly perturbed input data.

"For more realistic examples in numerical linear algebra, see Higham 2002 and other references below. Although, as noted previously, individual arithmetic operations of IEEE 754 are guaranteed accurate to within half a ULP, more complicated formulae can suffer from larger errors due to round-off. The loss of accuracy can be substantial if a problem or its data are ill-conditioned, meaning that the correct result is hypersensitive to tiny perturbations in its data.

"Another approach that can protect against the risk of numerical instabilities is the computation of intermediate (scratch) values in an algorithm at a higher precision than the final result requires, which can remove, or reduce by orders of magnitude, such risk: IEEE 754 quadruple precision and extended precision are designed for this purpose when computing at double precision.

"As decimal fractions can often not be exactly represented in binary floating-point, such arithmetic is at its best when it is simply being used to measure real-world quantities over a wide range of scales (such as the orbital period of a moon around Saturn or the mass of a proton), and at its worst when it is expected to model the interactions of quantities expressed as decimal strings that are expected to be exact. An example of the latter case is financial calculations. For this reason, financial software tends not to use a binary floating-point number representation.

"The ""decimal"" data type of the C# and Python programming languages, and the decimal formats of the IEEE 754-2008 standard, are designed to avoid the problems of binary floating-point representations when applied to human-entered exact decimal values, and make the arithmetic always behave as expected when numbers are printed in decimal. Expectations from mathematics may not be realized in the field of floating-point computation. For example, it is known that formula_32, and that formula_33, however these facts cannot be relied on when the quantities involved are the result of floating-point computation.

"The use of the equality test (codice_2) requires care when dealing with floating-point numbers. Even simple expressions like codice_3 will, on most computers, fail to be true (in IEEE 754 double precision, for example, codice_4 is approximately equal to -4.44089209850063e-16). Consequently, such tests are sometimes replaced with ""fuzzy"" comparisons (codice_5, where epsilon is sufficiently small and tailored to the application, such as 1.0E−13).
",2071
"The wisdom of doing this varies greatly, and can require numerical analysis to bound epsilon. Values derived from the primary data representation and their comparisons should be performed in a wider, extended, precision to minimize the risk of such inconsistencies due to round-off errors. It is often better to organize the code in such a way that such tests are unnecessary. For example, in computational geometry, exact tests of whether a point lies off or on a line or plane defined by other points can be performed using adaptive precision or exact arithmetic methods. Small errors in floating-point arithmetic can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations an enormous number of times.

"A few examples are matrix inversion, eigenvector computation, and differential equation solving. These algorithms must be very carefully designed, using numerical approaches such as Iterative refinement, if they are to work well. Summation of a vector of floating-point values is a basic algorithm in scientific computing, and so an awareness of when loss of significance can occur is essential. For example, if one is adding a very large number of numbers, the individual addends are very small compared with the sum. This can lead to loss of significance.

"A typical addition would then be something like The low 3 digits of the addends are effectively lost. Suppose, for example, that one needs to add many numbers, all approximately equal to 3. After 1000 of them have been added, the running sum is about 3000; the lost digits are not regained. The Kahan summation algorithm may be used to reduce the errors.

" A file viewer is an application software that presents the data stored in a computer file in a human-friendly form. The file contents are generally displayed on the screen, or they may be printed. Also, they may be read aloud using speech synthesis. File viewers do not edit files, yet it is common for them to be able to export data in a different file format, or to copy information from the viewed to the system-wide clipboard. A file viewer is limited-functionality software in the sense that it does not have a capability to create a file, or modify the content of an existing one.

"Instead, it is used only to display or print the content. File viewers have to have sufficient knowledge about the file format to be viewed in order to handle different byte orders, code pages or newline styles. Some file viewer may be classified as filters that translate binary files into plain text (one example antiword). However, depending on the competence of the translating routines, some information may be lost. Image viewers display graphics files onscreen. Most viewers are capable of reading multiple graphics file formats but some such as JPEGview are dedicated to a single format.

" In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives. Supervised learning algorithms perform the task of searching through a hypothesis space to find a suitable hypothesis that will make good predictions with a particular problem.
",2147
"Even if the hypothesis space contains hypotheses that are very well-suited for a particular problem, it may be very difficult to find a good one. Ensembles combine multiple hypotheses to form a (hopefully) better hypothesis. The term ""ensemble"" is usually reserved for methods that generate multiple hypotheses using the same base learner. The broader term of ""multiple classifier systems"" also covers hybridization of hypotheses that are not induced by the same base learner. Evaluating the prediction of an ensemble typically requires more computation than evaluating the prediction of a single model.
",2148
"In one sense, ensemble learning may be thought of as a way to compensate for poor learning algorithms by performing a lot of extra computation. On the other hand, the alternative is to do a lot more learning on one non-ensemble system. An ensemble system may be more efficient at improving overall accuracy for the same increase in compute, storage, or communication resources by using that increase on two or more methods, than would have been improved by increasing resource use for a single method. Fast algorithms such as decision trees are commonly used in ensemble methods (for example, random forests), although slower algorithms can benefit from ensemble techniques as well.
",2149
"By analogy, ensemble techniques have been used also in unsupervised learning scenarios, for example in consensus clustering or in anomaly detection. An ensemble is itself a supervised learning algorithm, because it can be trained and then used to make predictions. The trained ensemble, therefore, represents a single hypothesis. This hypothesis, however, is not necessarily contained within the hypothesis space of the models from which it is built. Thus, ensembles can be shown to have more flexibility in the functions they can represent.
",2150
"This flexibility can, in theory, enable them to over-fit the training data more than a single model would, but in practice, some ensemble techniques (especially bagging) tend to reduce problems related to over-fitting of the training data. Empirically, ensembles tend to yield better results when there is a significant diversity among the models. Many ensemble methods, therefore, seek to promote diversity among the models they combine. Although perhaps non-intuitive, more random algorithms (like random decision trees) can be used to produce a stronger ensemble than very deliberate algorithms (like entropy-reducing decision trees).
",2151
"Using a variety of strong learning algorithms, however, has been shown to be more effective than using techniques that attempt to ""dumb-down"" the models in order to promote diversity. While the number of component classifiers of an ensemble has a great impact on the accuracy of prediction, there is a limited number of studies addressing this problem. ""A priori"" determining of ensemble size and the volume and velocity of big data streams make this even more crucial for online ensemble classifiers. Mostly statistical tests were used for determining the proper number of components.
",2152
"More recently, a theoretical framework suggested that there is an ideal number of component classifiers for an ensemble such that having more or less than this number of classifiers would deteriorate the accuracy. It is called ""the law of diminishing returns in ensemble construction."" Their theoretical framework shows that using the same number of independent component classifiers as class labels gives the highest accuracy. The Bayes optimal classifier is a classification technique. It is an ensemble of all the hypotheses in the hypothesis space. On average, no other ensemble can outperform it.
",2153
"The naive Bayes optimal classifier is a version of this that assumes that the data is conditionally independent on the class and makes the computation more feasible. Each hypothesis is given a vote proportional to the likelihood that the training dataset would be sampled from a system if that hypothesis were true. To facilitate training data of finite size, the vote of each hypothesis is also multiplied by the prior probability of that hypothesis.
",2154
"The Bayes optimal classifier can be expressed with the following equation: where formula_2 is the predicted class, formula_3 is the set of all possible classes, formula_4 is the hypothesis space, formula_5 refers to a ""probability"", and formula_6 is the training data. As an ensemble, the Bayes optimal classifier represents a hypothesis that is not necessarily in formula_4. The hypothesis represented by the Bayes optimal classifier, however, is the optimal hypothesis in ""ensemble space"" (the space of all possible ensembles consisting only of hypotheses in formula_4).
",2155
"This formula can be restated using Bayes' theorem, which says that the posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior: hence, Bootstrap aggregating, often abbreviated as ""bagging"", involves having each model in the ensemble vote with equal weight. In order to promote model variance, bagging trains each model in the ensemble using a randomly drawn subset of the training set. As an example, the random forest algorithm combines random decision trees with bagging to achieve very high classification accuracy. In bagging the samples are generated in such a way that the samples are different from each other however replacement is allowed.
",2156
"Replacement means that an instance can occur in multiple samples a multiple times or it can not appear in some samples at all. These samples are then given to multiple learners and then the results from each learner are combined in the form of voting. Boosting involves incrementally building an ensemble by training each new model instance to emphasize the training instances that previous models mis-classified. In some cases, boosting has been shown to yield better accuracy than bagging, but it also tends to be more likely to over-fit the training data.
",2157
"By far, the most common implementation of boosting is Adaboost, although some newer algorithms are reported to achieve better results. In Boosting, an equal weight (uniform probability distribution) is given to the sample training data (say D1) at the very starting round. This data (D1) is then given to a base learner (say L1). The mis-classified instances by L1 are assigned a weight higher than the correctly classified instances, but keeping in mind that the total probability distribution will be equal to 1.
",2158
"This boosted data (say D2) is then given to second base learner (say L2) and so on. The results are then combined in the form of voting. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) makes predictions using an average over several models with weights given by the posterior probability of each model given the data. BMA is known to generally give better answers than a single model, obtained, e.g., via stepwise regression, especially where very different models have nearly identical performance in the training set but may otherwise perform quite differently.
",2159
"The most obvious question with any technique that uses Bayes' theorem is the prior, i.e., a specification of the probability (subjective, perhaps) that each model is the best to use for a given purpose. Conceptually, BMA can be used with any prior. The ensembleBMA and BMA packages for R use the prior implied by the , (BIC), following Raftery (1995). The BAS package for R supports the use of the priors implied by Akaike information criterion (AIC) and other criteria over the alternative models as well as priors over the coefficients.

"If on the other hand we are more concerned with efficiency, i.e., minimum mean square prediction error, then asymptotically, AIC and AICc are “efficient” while BIC is not. Burnham and Anderson (1998, 2002) contributed greatly to introducing a wider audience to the basic ideas of Bayesian model averaging and popularizing the methodology. The availability of software, including other free open-source packages for beyond those mentioned above, helped make the methods accessible to a wider audience. Haussler et al.
",2162
"(1994) showed that when BMA is used for classification, its expected error is at most twice the expected error of the Bayes optimal classifier. Bayesian model combination (BMC) is an algorithmic correction to Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Instead of sampling each model in the ensemble individually, it samples from the space of possible ensembles (with model weightings drawn randomly from a Dirichlet distribution having uniform parameters). This modification overcomes the tendency of BMA to converge toward giving all of the weight to a single model.
",2163
"Although BMC is somewhat more computationally expensive than BMA, it tends to yield dramatically better results. The results from BMC have been shown to be better on average (with statistical significance) than BMA, and bagging. The use of Bayes' law to compute model weights necessitates computing the probability of the data given each model. Typically, none of the models in the ensemble are exactly the distribution from which the training data were generated, so all of them correctly receive a value close to zero for this term.
",2164
"This would work well if the ensemble were big enough to sample the entire model-space, but such is rarely possible. Consequently, each pattern in the training data will cause the ensemble weight to shift toward the model in the ensemble that is closest to the distribution of the training data. It essentially reduces to an unnecessarily complex method for doing model selection. The possible weightings for an ensemble can be visualized as lying on a simplex. At each vertex of the simplex, all of the weight is given to a single model in the ensemble.
",2165
"BMA converges toward the vertex that is closest to the distribution of the training data. By contrast, BMC converges toward the point where this distribution projects onto the simplex. In other words, instead of selecting the one model that is closest to the generating distribution, it seeks the combination of models that is closest to the generating distribution. The results from BMA can often be approximated by using cross-validation to select the best model from a bucket of models. Likewise, the results from BMC may be approximated by using cross-validation to select the best ensemble combination from a random sampling of possible weightings.
",2166
"A ""bucket of models"" is an ensemble technique in which a model selection algorithm is used to choose the best model for each problem. When tested with only one problem, a bucket of models can produce no better results than the best model in the set, but when evaluated across many problems, it will typically produce much better results, on average, than any model in the set. The most common approach used for model-selection is cross-validation selection (sometimes called a ""bake-off contest"").
",2167
"It is described with the following pseudo-code: Cross-Validation Selection can be summed up as: ""try them all with the training set, and pick the one that works best"". Gating is a generalization of Cross-Validation Selection. It involves training another learning model to decide which of the models in the bucket is best-suited to solve the problem. Often, a perceptron is used for the gating model. It can be used to pick the ""best"" model, or it can be used to give a linear weight to the predictions from each model in the bucket.

"First, all of the other algorithms are trained using the available data, then a combiner algorithm is trained to make a final prediction using all the predictions of the other algorithms as additional inputs. If an arbitrary combiner algorithm is used, then stacking can theoretically represent any of the ensemble techniques described in this article, although, in practice, a logistic regression model is often used as the combiner. Stacking typically yields performance better than any single one of the trained models. It has been successfully used on both supervised learning tasks and unsupervised learning (density estimation).

"It has also been used to estimate bagging's error rate. It has been reported to out-perform Bayesian model-averaging. The two top-performers in the Netflix competition utilized ""blending"", which may be considered to be a form of stacking.

"Some of the applications of ensemble classifiers include: Land cover mapping is one of the major applications of Earth observation satellite sensors, using remote sensing and geospatial data, to identify the materials and objects which are located on the surface of target areas. Generally, the classes of target materials include roads, buildings, rivers, lakes, and vegetation. Some different ensemble learning approaches based on artificial neural networks, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), decision trees with boosting, random forest and automatic design of multiple classifier systems, are proposed to efficiently identify land cover objects.
",2172
"Change detection is an image analysis problem, consisting of the identification of places where the land cover has changed over time. Change detection is widely used in fields such as urban growth, forest and vegetation dynamics, land use and disaster monitoring. The earliest applications of ensemble classifiers in change detection are designed with the majority voting, Bayesian average and the maximum posterior probability. Distributed denial of service is one of the most threatening cyber-attacks that may happen to an internet service provider. By combining the output of single classifiers, ensemble classifiers reduce the total error of detecting and discriminating such attacks from legitimate flash crowds.

"Classification of malware codes such as computer viruses, computer worms, trojans, ransomware and spywares with the usage of machine learning techniques, is inspired by the document categorization problem. Ensemble learning systems have shown a proper efficacy in this area. An intrusion detection system monitors computer network or computer systems to identify intruder codes like an anomaly detection process. Ensemble learning successfully aids such monitoring systems to reduce their total error. Face recognition, which recently has become one of the most popular research areas of pattern recognition, copes with identification or verification of a person by his/her digital images.

"Hierarchical ensembles based on Gabor Fisher classifier and independent component analysis preprocessing techniques are some of the earliest ensembles employed in this field. While speech recognition is mainly based on deep learning because most of the industry players in this field like Google, Microsoft and IBM reveal that the core technology of their speech recognition is based on this approach, speech-based emotion recognition can also have a satisfactory performance with ensemble learning. It is also being successfully used in facial emotion recognition. Fraud detection deals with the identification of bank fraud, such as money laundering, credit card fraud and telecommunication fraud, which have vast domains of research and applications of machine learning.
",2175
"Because ensemble learning improves the robustness of the normal behavior modelling, it has been proposed as an efficient technique to detect such fraudulent cases and activities in banking and credit card systems. The accuracy of prediction of business failure is a very crucial issue in financial decision-making. Therefore, different ensemble classifiers are proposed to predict financial crises and financial distress. Also, in the trade-based manipulation problem, where traders attempt to manipulate stock prices by buying and selling activities, ensemble classifiers are required to analyze the changes in the stock market data and detect suspicious symptom of stock price manipulation.

"Through not seeing things this way, and behaving accordingly, we suffer. According to Anderson, the four truths have both a symbolic and a propositional function: As a symbol, they refer to the possibility of awakening, as represented by the Buddha, and are of utmost importance: As a proposition, they are part of the matrix or ""network of teachings"", in which they are ""not particularly central"", but have an equal place next to other teachings, describing how release from craving is to be reached.

"The majority of Niedenthal's research focuses on several levels of analysis of emotional processes, this would include emotion-cognition interaction and representational models of emotion. Niedenthal has authored more than 80 articles and chapters, and several books. Niedenthal is a fellow of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. Upon arriving at the University of Wisconsin–Madison as a full professor in 2011, Niedenthal assembled the Niedenthal Emotions Lab in order to continue past research and discover new research topics relating to human emotion.

"The four truths are to be internalised, and understood or ""experienced"" personally, to turn them into a lived reality. The four truths describe ""dukkha"" and its ending as a means to reach peace of mind in this life, but also as a means to end rebirth. According to Geoffrey Samuel, ""the Four Noble Truths [...] describe the knowledge needed to set out on the path to liberation from rebirth."" By understanding the four truths, one can stop this clinging and craving, attain a pacified mind, and be freed from this cycle of rebirth and redeath.

"One such study conducted by Niedenthal focuses primarily on the central sense of embodiment, referring to the brain's modality-specific systems which include the sensory systems that underlie perception of a current situation, the motor systems that underlie action, and the introspective systems that underlie conscious experiences of emotion, motivation and cognitive operations. Niedenthal employs the use of several theories of embodied cognition to explain how certain phenomena can be based specifically in such systems and bodily states.
",2183
"The main idea underlying theories of embodied cognition is that cognitive representations and operations are fundamentally grounded in their physical context, while cognition relies heavily on the brain's modality-specific systems and actual bodily states. Niedenthal believes that it is becoming increasingly essential to demonstrate the casual rules of embodiment in higher cognition.
",2184
"Consistent with the embodiment hypothesis; In her study participants that were free to mimic the expressions detected the change in emotional expression earlier and more efficiently for any facial expression than those who were prevented from mimicking the expressions. Further studies have shown that in regards to judgment, individuals embodied the relevant, discrete emotion as indicated by their facial expression. When certain emotions are experienced the resulting action is the stimulation of differing facial muscles depending on the response. Through the use of the electromyographic recording technique Niedenthal was able to observe the participants’ resulting facial expressions.
",2185
"Four such muscles that were activated were the orbicularis oculi, zygomaticus, the corrugator, and levator. It is also noted that embodiment does not occur when the information can be processed through association or perceptual features. According to Niedenthal, the perception of facial expressions of emotion can be affected by emotional states among many factors.
",2186
"In accordance with attachment orientation Niedenthal has proposed that lower level cognitive processes of perception such as the timing of the perceived offset of facial expressions of emotion influence the perception of facial expressions of different emotions such as happiness, anger, fear, and sadness. Defined as: ""the mental grouping together of objects and events that elicit the same emotion, and the treatment of those objects and events as ""the same kind of thing"""".

"Emotional response categorization enables an individual to choose an appropriate action in regards to their own categorization, allowing the individual to understand the meaning of an object based on their past experiences thus allowing for the individual to imagine their response and the outcome to an event or object. Proposed in 1999 by Niedenthal et al., emotional response categorization theory proposes that emotional states provide a form of conceptual coherence in that any objects or events that pertain to an emotion are grouped together into categories.
",2188
"The theory consists of three claims: Emotional state as well as arousal are important in facilitating memory in that objects and events can be distinguished into high and low-arousal categories. These arousal categories based on basic emotions form the basis for emotional learning that is essential for understanding. An individual is more likely to associate an emotional experience into a category based on relevance and emotional response categorization. Niedenthal proposes that the experienced emotional state increases the use of all emotional response categories and not just the one being experienced.

"Information of the oldest teachings of Buddhism, such as on the Four Noble Truths, has been obtained by analysis of the oldest texts and these inconsistencies, and are a matter of ongoing discussion and research. According to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished regarding the possibility to retain knowledge of the oldest Buddhism: According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may already have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, but did not have the central place they acquired in later buddhism.
",2190
"Niedenthal and colleagues contend that while experiencing an emotional state, an individual selectively attends the response to stimuli that have greater emotional meaning and importance. These previously experienced emotional responses have a larger impact on the judgments and behaviors. An individual experiencing a strong emotional state due to naturally occurring events will organize their perceptual and conceptual worlds differently from those in a neutral state. In other words: when experiencing a strong emotional state, an individual is more likely to associate the experienced emotion with the targeted objects or event(s).

The words were put into five categories, happy words, positive words that are unrelated to happiness, neutral words, negative words that are unrelated to sadness, and sad words. Niedenthal and Setterlund found that music can induce happy or sad moods. They also found that when in a happy mood, participants were quicker at identifying happy words than sad words. Such findings are in line with the emotion-congruence thesis.

"This research also makes the conclusion that our existing moods and emotions lead us to selectively perceive emotion-congruent objects and events. A 2008 study, conducted by Niedenthal and others, challenges research pertaining to the anger superiority effect. The anger superiority effect states that it is easier to detect angry faces than happy faces in a crowd neutral ones. This idea was said to have evolved over phylogenic development because it is beneficial to be able to quickly detect a threat in a given environment. Niedenthal et al.

"These sutras present a repeated sequence of events: Yet, in other sutras, where the four truths have a propositional function, the comprehension of the four truths destroys the corruptions. They do so in combination with the practice of the ""jhanas"" and the attainment of the divine eye, with which past lives and the working of rebirth are being seen. According to Anderson, following Schmithausen and Bronkhorst, these two presentations give two different models of the path to liberation, reflecting their function as a symbol and as a proposition.

"The causes of the high sex ratio in China result from a combination of strong son preference, the one-child policy, easy access to sex-selective abortion, and discrimination against and abuses of females. Son preference is traditional in Chinese Confucian patriarchal culture. Sons are preferred for a number of reasons: people think sons continue the family line or carry on the family name, have a higher wage-earning capacity, provide ancestral worship, and are generally recipients of inheritance, while girls are often considered as an economic burden. After marriage they typically become members of their husband's family and cease to have responsibility for aging or ill parents.

China's huge population translates these ratios into large numbers of excess males, which has contributed a large proportion of the global statistics on missing women.

He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg, who said that it looked like something in mathematical physics and that Montgomery should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which physicists have studied extensively.

"The primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ... are described by the Riemann zeta function, and Dyson had previously developed a description of quantum physics based on m by m arrays of totally random numbers. Montgomery and Dyson discovered that the ""eigenvalues"" of these matrices are spaced apart in exactly the same manner as Montgomery conjectured for the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function. Andrew Odlyzko has verified the conjecture on a computer, using his Odlyzko–Schönhage algorithm to calculate many zeros.

"There are in nature one, two, and three dimensional quasicrystals. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose Fourier transform is also a set of discrete points.

"Franconia may be distinguished from the regions that surround it by its peculiar historical factors and its cultural and especially linguistic characteristics, but it is not a political entity with a fixed or tightly defined area. As a result, it is debated whether some areas belong to Franconia or not. Pointers to a more precise definition of Franconia's boundaries include: the territories covered by the former Duchy of Franconia and former Franconian Circle, the range of the East Franconian dialect group, the common culture and history of the region and the use of the Franconian Rake on coats of arms, flags and seals.

Kleiner (2006) examined employment growth rates in states and occupations with stronger versus weaker occupational licensing requirements. Specifically, he compares employment growth between 1990 and 2000 of occupations that are licensed in some states to the same occupations that are not licensed in other states.

"In order to account for differential growth rates between states, he also compared the growth rate of occupations that are either fully licensed or fully unlicensed in both sets of states. Using a “difference-in-difference” regression analysis, Kleiner found that partially licensed occupations had a 20 percent lower growth rate in states with licensing relative to states without licensing and relative to the difference in growth rates between these sets of states of fully licensed and fully unlicensed occupations.

"Donations are a common way of getting money for web serials, often using services such as PayPal, but one of the main means of monetizing Web serials is advertising on blogs, which can allow writers to both host banners or purchase them on other sites and blogs. This can allow authors to recoup many of the costs associated with online novel creation. These are sometimes sufficient to cover the basic costs for hosting, and some of the more popular web serials can succeed with their entire budget made from donations or revenue of this type.
",2370
"Hosting and advertisement costs are still just as much a concern for non-organized web serial authors as webcomic artists. The advent of free blogging platforms such as the WordPress free host and Blogger have freed some serial writers from financial concerns, as well as any requirement for technical knowledge. However, these free hosts provide less flexibility and also may not be as scalable as a pay host. Many writers use platforms specifically created for hosting fiction.

"Web novels exist in both free-to-read and pay-to-read formats. Many free-to-read novels are indexed at sites such as Webfiction Guide or Muses Success. Most web novels are written as serials. Serialized novels have a long history, predating the internet by centuries. Fan fiction popularized the publishing of writing on the internet and set the standards for much of the community interaction surrounding web serials. Many fanfiction works have been published in multi-part works of epic length which prepared internet-based reading audiences for the easy digestion of serialized original works.
",2373
"Also, some web serial authors (and many authors in general) made their start in fanfiction before setting out for original work. Therefore, the readerships for fanfiction and web serials intersect quite a bit, and some fandom language and memes are shared by the web serial community. Most web serials tend towards regular publication schedules, however, whereas the bulk of fanfiction is published at the author's convenience. In fanfiction there is less obligation to finish or continue stories.

"Many fan fiction archives (such as the popular Fanfiction.net archive) are set up to accommodate and encourage the publication of serial works. Fanfiction.net has a sister site, Fiction Press, for original work. Authors of traditional paper-and-ink novels have sometimes tried to give readers an interactive experience, but this approach didn't become completely feasible until the development of digital media and hypertext. Traditional novels are linear, that is, read from page to page in a straight line. Interactive novels, however, offer readers a unique way to read fiction by choosing a page, a character, or a direction.

"By following hyperlinked phrases within the novel, readers can find new ways to understand characters. There is no wrong way to read a hypertext interactive novel. Links embedded within the pages are meant to be taken at a reader's discretion – to allow the reader a choice in the novel's world.

"Through the study of the modern process of regional climate on modern time scales, the interaction between monsoon and westerly winds is obvious, and this modern process can be used to imply the long-term interaction between the two climate systems. Paleoclimate simulations and lake records are two important means of past global change research. Simulation approach focuses on the study of paleoclimate change mechanism, and the lake record is mainly used for paleoclimate reconstruction. The combination of the two methods is an important way to understand paleoclimate change and long-term water cycle mechanisms.

"According to CCSM 3.0 paleoclimate models, lake water & energy balance models, paleoclimate simulation results match well with the lake records in monsoon marginal zones since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

" Map matching is the problem of how to match recorded geographic coordinates to a logical model of the real world, typically using some form of Geographic Information System. The most common approach is to take recorded, serial location points (e.g. from GPS) and relate them to edges in an existing street graph (network), usually in a sorted list representing the travel of a user or vehicle. Matching observations to a logical model in this way has applications in satellites navigation, GPS tracking of freight, and transportation engineering. Map matching algorithms can be divided in real-time and offline algorithms.

"Real-time algorithms associate the position during the recording process to the road network. Offline algorithms are used after the data is recorded and are then matched to the road network. Real-time applications can only calculate based upon the points prior to a given time (as opposed to those of a whole journey), but are intended to be used in 'live' environments. This brings a compromise of performance over accuracy. Offline applications can consider all points and so can tolerate slower performance in favour of accuracy.

" The HAT-Trie is a type of radix trie that uses array nodes to collect individual key–value pairs under radix nodes and hash buckets into an associative array. Unlike a simple hash table, HAT-tries store key–value in an ordered collection. The original inventors are Nikolas Askitis and Ranjan Sinha. Dr. Askitis shows that building and accessing the HAT-trie key/value collection is considerably faster than other sorted access methods and is comparable to the Array Hash which is an unsorted collection.
",2446
"This is due to the cache-friendly nature of the data structure which attempts to group access to data in time and space into the 64 byte cache line size of the modern CPU. A new HAT-Trie starts out as a NULL pointer representing an empty node. The first added key allocates the smallest array node and copies into it the key/value pair, which becomes the first root of the trie.

"Once the trie has grown into its first hash bucket node, the hash bucket distributes new keys according to a hash function of the key value into array nodes contained underneath the bucket node. Keys continue to be added until a maximum number of keys for a particular hash bucket node is reached. The bucket contents are then re-distributed into a new radix node according to the stored key value's first character, which replaces the hash bucket node as the trie root (e.g. see Burstsort).
",2449
"The existing keys and values contained in the hash bucket are each shortened by one character and placed under the new radix node in a set of new array nodes. Sorted access to the collection is provided by enumerating keys into a cursor by branching down the radix trie to assemble the leading characters, ending at either a hash bucket or an array node. Pointers to the keys contained in the hash bucket or array node are assembled into an array that is part of the cursor for sorting.

This is typical of the lack of understanding of how disease was transmitted and followed the general belief that water courses such as rivers and lakes were great sinks for purification of contaminated water.

"Again, though, other physicists believe that tunneling experiments in which particles appear to spend anomalously short times inside the barrier are in fact fully compatible with relativity, although there is disagreement about whether the explanation involves reshaping of the wave packet or other effects.

"In some models of broken Lorentz symmetry, it is postulated that the symmetry is still built into the most fundamental laws of physics, but that spontaneous symmetry breaking of Lorentz invariance shortly after the Big Bang could have left a ""relic field"" throughout the universe which causes particles to behave differently depending on their velocity relative to the field; however, there are also some models where Lorentz symmetry is broken in a more fundamental way.

"If Lorentz symmetry can cease to be a fundamental symmetry at the Planck scale or at some other fundamental scale, it is conceivable that particles with a critical speed different from the speed of light be the ultimate constituents of matter. In current models of Lorentz symmetry violation, the phenomenological parameters are expected to be energy-dependent. Therefore, as widely recognized, existing low-energy bounds cannot be applied to high-energy phenomena; however, many searches for Lorentz violation at high energies have been carried out using the Standard-Model Extension.

"Lorentz symmetry violation is expected to become stronger as one gets closer to the fundamental scale. In this approach the physical vacuum is viewed as a quantum superfluid which is essentially non-relativistic whereas Lorentz symmetry is not an exact symmetry of nature but rather the approximate description valid only for the small fluctuations of the superfluid background. Within the framework of the approach a theory was proposed in which the physical vacuum is conjectured to be a quantum Bose liquid whose ground-state wavefunction is described by the logarithmic Schrödinger equation.

"Kaplan had come across Fido as part of finding a BBS solution for his company, which worked with DEC computers and had been given a Rainbow computer and a USRobotics 1200bit/s modem. From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured that at least some of the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number.
",2640
"A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn. In the United States, local calls were normally free, and in most other countries were charged at a low rate. Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would be less expensive to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call.
",2641
"Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls. The team settled on the concept of adding a new ""network number"" patterned on the idea of area codes. A complete network address would now consist of the network and node number pair, which would be written with a slash between them.

"While Hart insists that judges are within bounds to legislate on the basis of rules of law, Dworkin strives to show that in these cases, judges work from a set of 'principles' which they use to formulate judgements, and that these principles either form the basis, or can be extrapolated from the present rules.
",2643
"Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would look it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period. A huge advantage of the new scheme was that node numbers were now unique only within their network, not globally. This meant the previous 250 node limit was gone, but for a variety of reasons this was initially limited to about 1,200.

"There is almost no commercial planting of this crop; fruits are collected from natural stands in the mountains near these provinces. In 1977, the Philippines exported approximately 3.8 t of pili preparation to Guam and Australia. The most important product from pili is the kernel. When raw, its flavor resembles that of roasted pumpkin seed, and when roasted, its nutty flavor and waxy texture make it similar to the pine nut. Research from the Institute of Plant Breeding, University of the Philippines at Los Banos, describes pili nuts of high quality as large, round kernel, and a thin pulp and shell.

"Points remain in use to this day but are less popular than when they were introduced. Although FidoNet supported file attachments from even the earliest standards, this feature tended to be rarely used and was often turned off. File attachments followed the normal mail routing through multiple systems and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered in the form of ""file requests"", which made file transfers driven by the ""calling"" system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing.

"By April 1993, the FidoNet nodelist contained over 20,000 systems. At that time it was estimated that each node had, on average, about 200 active users. Of these 4 million users in total, 2 million users commonly used echomail, the shared public forums, while about 200,000 used the private netmail system. At its peak, FidoNet listed approximately 39,000 systems. Throughout its lifetime, FidoNet was beset with management problems and infighting.
",2656
"As modems reached speeds of 28.8 kbit/s, the overhead of the TCP/IP protocols were no longer so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995, the bulletin board market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost.

"This structure is very similar to the organization structure of the Sicilian Mafia. Network coordinators (referred to as ""Button Men"") are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area, usually a city or similar sized area. Regional coordinators (referred to as ""Underbosses"") are responsible for managing the administration of the network coordinators within their region, typically the size of a state, or small country. Zone coordinators (referred to as either ""Dons"" or ""Godfathers"") are responsible for managing the administration of all of the regions within their zone.

"The world is divided into six zones, the coordinators of which appoint themselves or representatives to the positions of ""International Coordinators"" of FidoNet (referred to as ""La Cosa Nostra""). The six zone ""International Coordinators"", along with their Counselors (also known as their ""Consiglieres""), form the twelve person body known as ""FidoNet Central"". FidoNet was historically designed to use modem-based dial-up (POTS) access between bulletin board systems, and much of its policy and structure reflected this.

"The FidoNet system officially referred only to the transfer of ""Netmail""—the individual private messages between people using bulletin boards—including the protocols and standards with which to support it. A netmail message would contain the name of the person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it.

"These included the automated distribution of files and transmission of data for inter-BBS games. By far the most commonly used of these piggyback protocols was ""Echomail"", public discussions similar to Usenet newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the ""scanner""), compressed it using ARC or ZIP, attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system.
",2662
"The FidoNet hierarchy consists of ""zones"", ""regions"", ""networks"", ""nodes"" and ""points"" broken down more-or-less geographically. The highest level is the zone, which is largely continent-based: Each zone is broken down into regions, which are broken down into nets, which consist of individual nodes. Zones 7-4095 are used for ""othernets""; groupings of nodes that use Fido-compatible software to carry their own independent message areas without being in any way controlled by FidoNet's political structure.
",2663
"Using un-used zone numbers would ensure that each network would have a unique set of addresses, avoiding potential routing conflicts and ambiguities for systems that belonged to more than one network. FidoNet addresses explicitly consist of a ""zone"" number, a ""network"" number (or region number), and a ""node"" number. They are written in the form Zone:Network/Node. The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address.
",2664
"For example, consider a node located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States with an assigned node number is 918, located in Zone 1 (North America), Region 19, and Network 170. The full FidoNet address for this system would be 1:170/918. The ""region"" was used for administrative purposes, and was only part of the address if the node was listed directly underneath the Regional Coordinator, rather than one of the networks that were used to divide the region further. FidoNet policy requires that each FidoNet system maintain a ""nodelist"" of every other member system.
",2665
"For example, a FidoNet message might follow the path: Originally there was no specific relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the node number to the hub number if the network is large enough to contain any hubs.
",2666
"Region number × 20 Then when some regions started running out of network numbers, the following was also used. Region number × 200 Region 19, for instance, contains nets 380-399 and 3800-3999 in addition to those that were in Region 19 when it was formed.
",2667
"Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, but it was also common for people to volunteer to pay for regular toll calls either out of generosity or to build their status in the community. This ad-hoc system was particularly popular with networks that were built on top of FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively large file transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead.
",2668
"""Points"" were introduced to address this, allowing technically-savvy users to receive the already compressed and batched Echomail (and Netmail) and read it locally on their own machines. To do this, the FidoNet addressing scheme was extended with the addition of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address 1:170/918.10. In real-world use, points are fairly difficult to set up.

"While the SR.N6 had helped to prove the value of hovercraft, it was not without its flaws; due to its dependency on aviation-derived technologies, Hovertravel's fleet became increasingly expensive to maintain over time, while its high noise output was not an attractive feature either.

"BBS software would allow dial-in users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes. Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system. Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users in a variety of ways (i.e. : node to node chat).
",2675
"When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it from time to time by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further. Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems. ""BBS software"" was used to interact with human callers to the system.
",2676
"""Mailer software"" was responsible for transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times. The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols. If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user.

"They were used to illustrate some aspect of the lesson (map of invasions, timelines, internal organs, etc. ), and they were drawn or made by computer graphics. The term ""edugraphic"" is born from its cousin ""infographic"" which is relatively recent and the result of considerable debate in the design community. The Society for Technical Communication group describes infographics as ""the translation of complex, unorganized or unstructured data into valuable, meaningful information"". Comenius used a visual education with the publication of ""Orbis Pictus"" in 1658.

"For example, in history textbooks, the use of timelines was highly effective for its power to illustrate several historical information elements in one straight line. Maps showed the population of a country, its social status, etc. The images used were called ""graphics"", ""pie-charts"", ""bar-charts"", ""maps"". MOOCs will make edugraphics - which are highly adapted for these open courses - necessary.

"The difference between infographics and edugraphics are basically the way contents are treated because they are not data but pedagogical content, like theories, process, rules, (grammar and maths), etc. Infographics may be used in school for pedagogical purposes but are not intended to explain pedagogical facts. Edugraphics combines 3 basic elements: visual content (icons, images, colors), pedagogical content, and a learning scenario (story). Visuals are a basic and important element.

"Basic notions of design should be used to create an edugraphic, for instance how to use colors properly (contrast), how to use fonts meaningfully and how to organize every single element in a canvas. Pedagogical content is the main reason for creating an edugraphic. The contents have to be related to a specific subject for the course. For example, in a French course, if the teacher is explaining the vocabulary of the body (head, mouth, eyes, etc.

"This led to the development of the B horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes. The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell. Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns. In addition, the single B horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn.

"During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an antiparallel orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the base pairs in the centre of a double helix.

"At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations, although it did start him thinking about complementary replication. Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson ""playing"" with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Linus Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier.

"Harassment directs multiple repeating obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing photos of the victim and their families, doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media with the aim of causing emotional distress (see cyberbullying, cyberstalking, hate crime, online predator, Online Gender-Based Violence, and stalking).

"However, Kubota (1925) responded to Bateman by arguing that the Laguerre inversion is involutory whereas the Lorentz transformation is not. He concluded that in order to make them equivalent, the Laguerre inversion has to be combined with a reversal of direction of the cycles. The specific relation between the Lorentz transformation and the Laguerre inversion can also be demonstrated as follows (see H.R. Müller (1948) for analogous formulas in different notation).

The targeting of an individual because of their race or ethnicity. The harassment may include words, deeds, and actions that are specifically designed to make the target feel degraded due to their race or ethnicity. Verbal, psychological or physical harassment is used against targets because they choose to practice a specific religion. Religious harassment can also include forced and involuntary conversions.

"In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small ""adaptor molecules"" that would hydrogen bond to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids. He also explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short nucleic acid sequences might code for the 20 amino acids. During the mid-to-late 1950s Crick was very much intellectually engaged in sorting out the mystery of how proteins are synthesised.

"In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a law which prohibited the transmission of annoying messages over the Internet (""aka"" spamming) without disclosing the sender's true identity. An important standard in U.S. federal harassment law is that to be unlawful, the offending behavior either must be ""severe or pervasive enough to create a work environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive,"" or that enduring the offensive conduct becomes a condition of continued employment; e.g. if the employee is fired or threatened with firing upon reporting the conduct.

"Crick also used the term ""central dogma"" to summarise an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one-way: Some critics thought that by using the word ""dogma"", Crick was implying that this was a rule that could not be questioned, but all he really meant was that it was a compelling idea without much solid evidence to support it. In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow.

In the Urartian age, agriculture was well developed and closely related to Assyrian methods on the selection of cultures and methods of processing. From cuneiform sources, it is known that in Urartu grew wheat, barley, sesame, millet, and emmer, and cultivated gardens and vineyards. Many regions of the Urartu state required artificial irrigation, which has successfully been organized by the rulers of Urartu in the heyday of the state.

Stone remains are mainly fortresses and walls, with temples and mausolea, and many rock-cut tombs.

" Rigidity theory, or topological constraint theory, is a tool for predicting properties of complex networks (such as glasses) based on their composition. It was introduced by Phillips in 1979 and 1981, and refined by Thorpe in 1983. Inspired by the study of the stability of mechanical trusses as pioneered by James Clerk Maxwell, and by the seminal work on glass structure done by William Houlder Zachariasen, this theory reduces complex molecular networks to nodes (atoms, molecules, proteins, etc.) constrained by rods (chemical constraints), thus filtering out microscopic details that ultimately don't affect macroscopic properties.
",2841
"An equivalent theory was developed by P.K. Gupta A.R. Cooper in 1990, where rather than nodes representing atoms, they represented unit polytopes. An example of this would be the SiO tetrahedra in pure glassy silica. This style of analysis has applications in biology and chemistry, such as understanding adaptability in protein-protein interaction networks. Rigidity theory applied to the molecular networks arising from phenotypical expression of certain diseases may provide insights regarding their structure and function.
",2842
"In molecular networks, atoms can be constrained by radial 2-body bond-stretching constraints, which keep interatomic distances fixed, and angular 3-body bond-bending constraints, which keep angles fixed around their average values. As stated by Maxwell's criterion, a mechanical truss is isostatic when the number of constraints equals the number of degrees of freedom of the nodes. In this case, the truss is optimally constrained, being rigid but free of stress.
",2843
"This criterion has been applied by Phillips to molecular networks, which are called flexible, stressed-rigid or isostatic when the number of constraints per atoms is respectively lower, higher or equal to 3, the number of degrees of freedom per atom in a three-dimensional system. The same condition applies to random packing of spheres, which are isostatic at the jamming point. Typically, the conditions for glass formation will be optimal if the network is isostatic, which is for example the case for pure silica.
",2844
"Flexible systems show internal degrees of freedom, called floppy modes, whereas stressed-rigid ones are complexity locked by the high number of constraints and tend to crystallize instead of forming glass during a quick quenching. The conditions for isostaticity can be derived by looking at the internal degrees of freedom of a general 3D network. For formula_1 nodes, formula_2 constraints, and formula_3 equations of equilibrium, the number of degrees of freedom is formula_4 The node term picks up a factor of 3 due to there being transnational degrees of freedom in the x, y, and z directions.
",2845
"By similar reasoning, formula_5 in 3D, as there is one equation of equilibrium for translational and rotational modes in each dimension. This yields formula_6 This can be applied to each node in the system by normalizing by the number of nodes formula_7 where formula_8, formula_9, and the last term has been dropped since for atomistic systems formula_10. Isostatic conditions are achieved when formula_11, yielding the number of constraints per atom in the isostatic condition of formula_12. An alternative derivation is based on analyzing the shear modulus formula_13 of the 3D network or solid structure.
",2846
"The isostatic condition, which represents the limit of mechanical stability, is equivalent to setting formula_14 in a microscopic theory of elasticity that provides formula_13 as a function of the internal coordination number of nodes and of the number of degrees of freedom. The problem has been solved by Alessio Zaccone and E. Scossa-Romano in 2011, who derived the analytical formula for the shear modulus of a 3D network of central-force springs (bond-stretching constraints): formula_16.
",2847
"Here, formula_17 is the spring constant, formula_18 is the distance between two nearest-neighbor nodes, formula_19 the average coordination number of the network (note that here formula_20 and formula_21), and formula_22 in 3D. A similar formula has been derived for 2D networks where the prefactor is formula_23 instead of formula_24. Hence, based on the Zaccone-Scossa-Romano expression for formula_13, upon setting formula_26, one obtains formula_27, or equivalently in different notation, formula_28, which defines the Maxwell isostatic condition.
",2848
"A similar analysis can be done for 3D networks with bond-bending interactions (on top of bond-stretching), which leads to the isostatic condition formula_29, with a lower threshold due to the angular constraints imposed by bond-bending. Rigidity theory allows the prediction of optimal isostatic compositions, as well as the composition dependence of glass properties, by a simple enumeration of constraints. These glass properties include, but are not limited to, elastic modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, density, Poisson's ratio, coefficient of thermal expansion, hardness, and toughness.
",2849
"In some systems, due to the difficulty of directly enumerating constraints by hand and knowing all system information ""a priori"", the theory is often employed in conjunction with computational methods in materials science such as molecular dynamics (MD). Notably, the theory played a major role in the development of Gorilla Glass 3. Extended to glasses at finite temperature and finite pressure, rigidity theory has been used to predict glass transition temperature, viscosity and mechanical properties. It was also applied to granular materials and proteins.

"Because potassium ferrocyanide may form hydrogen cyanide its use is highly regulated and, in many wine producing countries, illegal. Silica and kaolin are also sometimes used. Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have wine labeling laws that require the use of fining agents that may be an allergenic substance to appear on the wine label.

"There is the risk of valuable aromatic molecules being precipitated out along with the less desirable matter. Some producers of premium wine avoid fining, or delay it in order to leach more flavor and aroma from the phenols before they are removed. While fining clarifies wine by binding to suspended particles and precipitating out as larger particles, filtration works by passing the wine through a filter medium that captures particles larger than the medium's holes. Complete filtration may require a series of filtering through progressively finer filters.

"Many white wines require the removal of all potentially active yeast and/or lactic acid bacteria if they are to remain reliably stable in bottle, and this is usually now achieved by fine filtration. Most filtration in a winery can be classified as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration.

In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane.
",2862
"Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as cross-flow filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling.

The new understanding of benzene, and hence of all aromatic compounds, proved to be so important for both pure and applied chemistry after 1865 that in 1890 the German Chemical Society organized an elaborate appreciation in Kekulé's honor, celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first benzene paper.

In France and England, by contrast, large castles were usually in the hands of a single powerful feudal lord. This is mainly due to the different way that feudalism developed in those countries due to their different regional situations. Several examples of large ""multi-family castles"" have survived, especially in southern France and the Massif Central.

It is forward-looking and not reverse looking, it doesn't try to fit everything into the past; it tries to construct a new future. **Mary** : That's exciting, yes.

And you only really need fifteen or twenty of these qualities or attributes of Divine Truth to know whether something's right or wrong, right from the beginning.

"The vision set forth in de Klerk's address was for South Africa to become a Western-style liberal democracy; with a market-oriented economy which valued private enterprise and restricted the government's role in economics. De Klerk later related that ""that speech was mainly aimed at breaking our stalemate in Africa and the West. Internationally we were teetering on the edge of the abyss."" Throughout South Africa and across the world, there was astonishment at de Klerk's move. Foreign press coverage was largely positive and de Klerk received messages of support from other governments.

" Experimental approaches of determining the structure of nucleic acids, such as RNA and DNA, can be largely classified into biophysical and biochemical methods. Biophysical methods use the fundamental physical properties of molecules for structure determination, including X-ray crystallography, NMR and cryo-EM. Biochemical methods exploit the chemical properties of nucleic acids using specific reagents and conditions to assay the structure of nucleic acids. Such methods may involve chemical probing with specific reagents, or rely on native or analogue chemistry. Different experimental approaches have unique merits and are suitable for different experimental purposes.

"Inside the capsid is a linear, single-stranded DNA genome in the size range 4–6 kbp, so the small genome of parvovirus can encode only a few proteins. At the 5’ and 3’ ends of this genome are short complementary sequences of roughly 120 to 550 nucleotides that form secondary structures as hairpins for example inverted terminal repeats (ITRs, which are two identical secondary structures at the termini) or unique sequences at the termini (two unique and different secondary structures are at each end of the DNA) and are essential for viral genome replication mechanism called rolling-hairpin replication.
",2981
"As of 2003, nearly half of all known RNA structures had been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Nucleic acid NMR uses similar techniques as protein NMR, but has several differences. Nucleic acids have a smaller percentage of hydrogen atoms, which are the atoms usually observed in NMR, and because nucleic acid double helices are stiff and roughly linear, they do not fold back on themselves to give ""long-range"" correlations. The types of NMR usually done with nucleic acids are H or proton NMR, C NMR, N NMR, and P NMR.
",2982
"X-ray crystallography is not common for nucleic acids alone, since neither DNA nor RNA readily form crystals. This is due to the greater degree of intrinsic disorder and dynamism in nucleic acid structures and the negatively charged (deoxy)ribose-phosphate backbones, which repel each other in close proximity. Therefore, crystallized nucleic acids tend to be complexed with a protein of interest to provide structural order and neutralize the negative charge. Nucleic acid NMR is the use of NMR spectroscopy to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of nucleic acid molecules, such as DNA or RNA.
",2983
"For large-scale structure, these local parameters must be supplemented with other structural assumptions or models, because errors add up as the double helix is traversed, and unlike with proteins, the double helix does not have a compact interior and does not fold back upon itself. NMR is also useful for investigating nonstandard geometries such as bent helices, non-Watson–Crick basepairing, and coaxial stacking. It has been especially useful in probing the structure of natural RNA oligonucleotides, which tend to adopt complex conformations such as stem-loops and pseudoknots.
",2984
"Two-dimensional NMR methods are almost always used, such as correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and total coherence transfer spectroscopy (TOCSY) to detect through-bond nuclear couplings, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) to detect couplings between nuclei that are close to each other in space. Parameters taken from the spectrum, mainly NOESY cross-peaks and coupling constants, can be used to determine local structural features such as glycosidic bond angles, dihedral angles (using the Karplus equation), and sugar pucker conformations.
",2985
"One disadvantage, is that it is difficult to resolve nucleic acid or protein structures that are smaller than ~75 kilodaltons, partly due to the difficulty of having enough contrast to locate particles in this vitrified aqueous solution. Another disadvantage is that to attain atomic-level structure information about a sample requires taking many images (often referred to as electron micrographs) and averaging over those images in a process called single-particle reconstruction. This is a computationally intensive process. Cryo-EM is a newer, less perturbative version of transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
",2986
"It is less perturbative because the sample is not dried onto a surface, this drying process is often done in negative-stain TEM, and because Cryo-EM does not require contrast agent like heavy metal salts (e.g. uranyl acetate or phoshotungstic acid) which also may affect the structure of the biomolecule. Transmission electron microscopy, as a technique, utilizes the fact that samples interact with a beam of electrons and only parts of the sample that do not interact with the electron beam are allowed to 'transmit' onto the electron detection system.

"Viruses in most genera are mono-sense, meaning that both viral genes are transcribed in a single direction from open reading frames in the same (positive-sense) DNA strand, but members of one genus of homotelomeric invertebrate viruses (genus ""Ambidensovirus"") show ambisense organization, with the NS and capsid proteins being transcribed in opposite directions from the 5’-ends of the two complementary DNA strands (see reference 1 and ).
",2988
"The major non-structural protein, NS1, is a site- and strand-specific endonuclease belonging to the HuH protein superfamily, and also carries a AAA+ SF3 helicase domain. NS1 initiates and drives the viral “rolling hairpin” replication mechanism (RHR), which is a linear adaptation of the more-common “rolling-circle” replication strategy used by many small circular prokaryotic and viral replicons.
",2989
"These studies have resolved structural features at different resolutions from the nucleobase level (2-3 angstroms) up to tertiary structure motifs (greater than a nanometer). RNA chemical probing uses chemicals that react with RNAs. Importantly, their reactivity depends on local RNA structure e.g. base-pairing or accessibility. Differences in reactivity can therefore serve as a footprint of structure along the sequence. Different reagents react at different positions on the RNA structure, and have different spectra of reactivity.
",2990
"The collection of DNA molecules of various truncated lengths therefore informs the frequency of reaction at every base position, which reflects the structure profile along the RNA. This is traditionally assayed by running the DNA on a gel, and the intensity of bands inform the frequency of observing a truncation at each position. Recent approaches use high-throughput sequencing to achieve the same purpose with greater throughput and sensitivity. The reactivity profile can be used to study the degree of structure at particular positions for specific hypotheses, or used in conjunction with computational algorithms to produce a complete experimentally supported structure model.
",2991
"Depending on the chemical reagent used, some reagents, e.g. hydroxyl radicals, would cleave the RNA molecule instead. The result in the truncated DNA is the same. Some reagents, e.g. DMS, sometimes do not block the reverse transcriptase, but trigger a mistake at the site in the DNA copy instead. These can be detected when using high-throughput sequencing methods, and is sometimes employed for improved results of probing as mutational profiling (MaP).
",2992
"All parvoviruses encode two major gene complexes: the non-structural (or rep) gene that encodes the replication initiator protein (called NS1 or Rep), and the VP (or cap) gene, which encodes a nested set of ~2–6 size variants derived from the C-terminus of the single VP protein sequence.
",2993
"The ends of the genome are double stranded as a result of base pairing, and at the 3' end the terminal nucleotides act as a primer to which the polymerase binds. The cell's RNA polymerase II transcribes the virus genes and cell transcription factors play key roles. The primary transcript(s) undergo various splicing events to produce several size classes of mRNA. The larger mRNAs encode the non-structural proteins and the smaller mRNAs encode the structural proteins.
",2994
"Improving upon truncation-based methods, DMS mutational profiling with sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) can detect multiple DMS modifications in a single RNA molecule, which enables one to obtain more information per read (for a read of 150 nt, typically two to three mutation sites, rather than zero to one truncation sites), determine structures of low-abundance RNAs, and identify subpopulations of RNAs with alternative secondary structures.

"Compared to the chemicals used in other RNA probing techniques, these reagents have the advantage of being largely unbiased to base identity, while remaining very sensitive to conformational dynamics. Nucleotides which are constrained (usually by base-pairing) show less adduct formation than nucleotides which are unpaired. Adduct formation is quantified for each nucleotide in a given RNA by extension of a complementary DNA primer with reverse transcriptase and comparison of the resulting fragments with those from an unmodified control. SHAPE therefore reports on RNA structure at the individual nucleotide level.

"This data can be used as input to generate highly accurate secondary structure models. SHAPE has been used to analyze diverse RNA structures, including that of an entire HIV-1 genome.

"They are excellent vectors for experimental or clinical gene transduction and are now being used in patients for the therapeutic treatment of certain genetic diseases. The biggest advantage for such applications is that they are not known to cause any diseases. Unlike dependoparvoviruse, autonomous parvoviruses do not require a helper virus. The autonomous parvovirus genome is a linear ssDNA with terminal palindromes, and several viruses have different sorts of palindromes at each end which are known to package the negative sense DNA strand for the most part.
",3003
"Most autonomous parvoviruses are known to encode only two NS structural proteins. Similar to RNA viruses, autonomous parvoviruses are highly effective when cells are in the S phase. Autonomous parvovirus replication occurs through hairpins being formed by the palindrome at the 3′ end of the viral genome. This acts as a primer for the synthesis of complementary strands. Elongating strands then become covalently linked to hairpins at the 5' end of the template to create a linear duplex model that has covalent cross-links at the ends by DNA hairpins.

"In-line probing does not involve treatment with any type of chemical or reagent to modify RNA structures. This type of probing assay uses the structure dependent cleavage of RNA; single stranded regions are more flexible and unstable and will degrade over time. The process of in-line probing is often used to determine changes in structure due to ligand binding. Binding of a ligand can result in different cleavage patterns. The process of in-line probing involves incubation of structural or functional RNAs over a long period of time. This period can be several days, but varies in each experiment.

"Similarly, samples from aquatic animals that are also present in the surrounding environment are difficult to attribute until they can be shown to directly infect other members of the presumed host species. Despite these caveats, every year many new viruses are identified that will likely merit recognition, so that the published taxonomy always trails studies in the field.

"This assay is commonly used in dynamic studies, specifically when examining riboswitches. Nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) is the process of using nucleotide analogs, molecules that are similar in some ways to nucleotides but lack function, to determine the importance of a functional group at each location of an RNA molecule. The process of NAIM is to insert a single nucleotide analog into a unique site.

"This can be done by transcribing a short RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, then synthesizing a short oligonucleotide containing the analog in a specific position, then ligating them together on the DNA template using a ligase. The nucleotide analogs are tagged with a phosphorothioate, the active members of the RNA population are then distinguished from the inactive members, the inactive members then have the phosphorothioate tag removed and the analog sites are identified using gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.

"This process can be used to evaluate an entire area, where analogs are placed in site specific locations, differing by a single nucleotide, then when functional RNAs are isolated and run on a gel, all areas where bands are produced indicate non-essential nucleotides, but areas where bands are absent from the functional RNA indicate that inserting a nucleotide analog in that position caused the RNA molecule to become non-functional

"Mature virions may be released from infected cells prior to cell lysis, which promotes rapid transmission of the virus, but if this fails, then the virus is released at cell lysis. Unlike most other DNA viruses, parvoviruses are unable to activate DNA synthesis in host cells. Thus, for viral replication to take place, the infected cells must typically be nonquiescent (i.e. must be actively mitotic). Their inability to force host cells into S-phase means that parvoviruses are nontumorigenic.

With this the F-111B's end appeared near by mid-1967. By May 1968 both Armed Services committees of Congress voted not to fund production and in July 1968 the DoD ordered work stopped on F-111B. A total of seven F-111Bs were delivered by February 1969.

" Star-shaped polymers are the simplest class of branched polymers with a general structure consisting of several (at least three) linear chains connected to a central core. The core, or the center, of the polymer can be an atom, molecule, or macromolecule; the chains, or ""arms"", consist of variable-length organic chains. Star-shaped polymers in which the arms are all equivalent in length and structure are considered homogeneous, and ones with variable lengths and structures are considered heterogeneous.

"Heteroarm polymers have been shown to aggregate into particularly interesting supramolecular formations such as stars, segmented ribbons, and core-shell-corona micellar assemblies depending on their arms' solubility in solution, which can be affected by changes in temperature, pH, solvent, etc. These self-assembly properties have implications for solubility of the whole star polymers themselves and for other solutes in solution. For Heteroarm polymers, increasing the molecular weight of soluble chains increases the overall solubility of the star.
",3078
"Certain Heteroarm star-block polymers have been shown to stabilize water-organic solvent emulsions, while others have demonstrated the ability to increase the solubility of inorganic salts in organic solutions. Star-shaped polymers can be synthesized through various approaches. The most common syntheses include an arm-first approach, in which the living chains are used as the initiators, and a core-first approach, in which the core is used as the initiator.
",3079
"The active site at the end of their chain can be directly reacted with an appropriately reactive multifunctional polymer core (also known as a linking agent) to produce a star-shaped polymer. In this approach the resulting star-polymer consists of homogeneous chain groups. The arm-first synthesis route is arguably the most efficient synthesis of star-shaped polymers. This is because each step can be directly controlled and assessed; the arms and core can be isolated and characterized prior to a stoichiometric reaction, and the functionality of the final star-polymer can then be accurately and directly measured.
",3080
"One common approach to the arm-first synthesis is through anionic polymerization methods. This involves using ""arms"" that are anionic and reacting them with a core containing deactivating groups for the arms to react with. The deactivating groups on the core are often chlorosilanes, chlorine leaving groups, or deactivating alkenes.
",3081
"Chlorosilane derivatives serve as especially reactive cores, and can react quantitatively (or very close to quantitatively) with carbanion living polymers; this reaction involves carbanions performing electrophilic substitution with the Si-Cl groups (as shown in the below figure). In a case like this, the resulting arms are all homogeneous and can be well characterized, and the core can also be well characterized, leading to a well-characterized star-shaped polymer.

"Manufacturing activity is modest, consisting mainly of a garment factory in Yap and production of buttons from trochus shells. The large inflow of official assistance to FSM allows it to run a substantial trade deficit and to have a much lighter tax burden than other states in the region (11% of GDP in FSM compared to 18–25% elsewhere). The government also borrowed against future Compact disbursements in the early 1990s, yielding an external debt of $111 million in 1997 (over 50% of GDP). There are no patent laws in Micronesia.
",3083
"Since both the core and the arms are rather reactive, essentially all Si-Cl undergo electrophilic substitution, and the resulting star-shaped polymers thus have a rather narrow polydispersity index. In the core-first approach (also known as the ""arm-out"" or divergent approach), a multifunctional core serves as the initiator simultaneously for several arms. This approach proves to be more complicated than the arm-first approach, in that finding an appropriate and stable core is difficult, and characterizing the synthesized star-polymer is challenging.

" A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). Fourier analysis converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by factorizing the DFT matrix into a product of sparse (mostly zero) factors.
",3122
"As a result, it manages to reduce the complexity of computing the DFT from formula_1, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to formula_2, where formula_3 is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ""N"" may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of round-off error, many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple complex-number arithmetic to group theory and number theory.

",3125
"Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/""N"" factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it. The development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to Carl Friedrich Gauss's unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids Pallas and Juno from sample observations. His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by James Cooley and John Tukey, who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm.
",3126
"While Gauss's work predated even Joseph Fourier's results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal. Between 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. Frank Yates in 1932 published his version called ""interaction algorithm"", which provided efficient computation of Hadamard and Walsh transforms.

"As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing. Let ""x"", …, ""x"" be complex numbers. The DFT is defined by the formula where formula_8 is a primitive th root of 1. Evaluating this definition directly requires formula_1 operations: there are ""N"" outputs ""X"", and each output requires a sum of ""N"" terms.
",3131
"An FFT is any method to compute the same results in formula_2 operations. All known FFT algorithms require Θformula_11 operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible. To illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ""N"" complex multiplications and ""N""(""N"" − 1) complex additions, of which formula_12 operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations.
",3132
"On the other hand, the radix-2 Cooley–Tukey algorithm, for ""N"" a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (""N""/2)log(""N"") complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ""N"" log(""N"") complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation.
",3133
"In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & Johnson, 2005), but the overall improvement from formula_1 to formula_2 remains. By far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley–Tukey algorithm.
",3134
"In discussion with Tukey, Richard Garwin recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.

"This method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965, but it was later discovered that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1805 (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).
",3136
"The best known use of the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ""N""/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey). These are called the ""radix-2"" and ""mixed-radix"" cases, respectively (and other variants such as the split-radix FFT have their own names as well).
",3137
"Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley–Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below. There are FFT algorithms other than Cooley–Tukey. Cornelius Lanczos did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS (fast Fourier sampling method) with G. C. Danielson (1940).

Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and QFT algorithms.

"(The Rader–Brenner and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ""N"".

",3141
"Another polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm, which factorizes ""z"" − 1 into cyclotomic polynomials—these often have coefficients of 1, 0, or −1, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors.

Montclair hosts many art institutions and theaters, and despite its relatively small size, has many art venues. It has its own art museum, the Montclair Art Museum, and several small galleries.
",3143
"Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(""N"") irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern processors with hardware multipliers. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ""prime"" sizes.
",3144
"Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the chirp-z algorithm; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ""same"" size (which can be zero-padded to a power of two and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley–Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity Hexagonal fast Fourier transform aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).
",3145
"In many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry and efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987). One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley–Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory.
",3146
"Alternatively, it is possible to express an ""even""-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(""N"") post-processing operations.
",3147
"It was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the discrete Hartley transform (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs. Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.
",3148
"There are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have even/odd symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the discrete cosine/sine transform(s) (DCT/DST). Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(""N"") pre- and post-processing.
",3149
"A fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the complexity and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require Ω(""N"" log ""N"") (i.e., order ""N"" log ""N"" or greater) operations, even for the simple case of power of two sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known.
",3150
"In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as cache or CPU pipeline optimization. Following work by Shmuel Winograd (1978), a tight Θ(""N"") lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only formula_17 irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length formula_18.
",3151
"Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & Burrus, 1986; Duhamel, 1990). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990; Frigo & Johnson, 2005). A tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms.
",3152
"In 1973, Morgenstern proved an Ω(""N"" log ""N"") lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of formula_19), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix) under the same scaling.
",3153
"Pan (1986) proved an Ω(""N"" log ""N"") lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's ""asynchronicity"", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ""N"", Papadimitriou (1979) argued that the number formula_20 of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley–Tukey algorithms is ""optimal"" under certain assumptions on the graph of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited).

"(This argument would imply that at least formula_21 real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than formula_20 complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two ""N"". A third problem is to minimize the ""total"" number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the ""arithmetic complexity"" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).
",3156
"A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ""N"" ≥ 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ""N"" ≤ 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a satisfiability modulo theories problem solvable by brute force (Haynal & Haynal, 2011). Most of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest.
",3157
"However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, discrete cosine transforms, discrete Hartley transforms, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990). All of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting floating-point errors).
",3158
"A few ""FFT"" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ""approximately"", with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999) achieves lower communication requirements for parallel computing with the help of a fast multipole method.

"A wavelet-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996) takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995). The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data.
",3160
"Conversely, if the data are sparse—that is, if only ""K"" out of ""N"" Fourier coefficients are nonzero—then the complexity can be reduced to O(""K""log(""N"")log(""N""/""K"")), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ""N""/""K"" > 32 in a large-""N"" example (""N"" = 2) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ""K"" coefficients to several decimal places).
",3161
"FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley–Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the pairwise summation structure of the algorithms. The upper bound on the relative error for the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is O(""ε"" log ""N""), compared to O(""εN"") for the naïve DFT formula, where ε is the machine floating-point relative precision.
",3162
"In fact, the root mean square (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(""ε"" ) for Cooley–Tukey and O(""ε"" ) for the naïve DFT (Schatzman, 1996). These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the trigonometric function values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate trigonometric recurrence formulas.
",3163
"Some FFTs other than Cooley–Tukey, such as the Rader–Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable. In fixed-point arithmetic, the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O() for the Cooley–Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969). Achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley–Tukey.
",3164
"Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ""N"" was long achieved by the split-radix FFT algorithm, which requires formula_23 real multiplications and additions for ""N"" > 1. This was recently reduced to formula_24 (Johnson and Frigo, 2007; Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007).

"As defined in the multidimensional DFT article, the multidimensional DFT transforms an array ""x"" with a ""d""-dimensional vector of indices formula_26 by a set of ""d"" nested summations (over formula_27 for each ""j""), where the division n/N, defined as formula_28, is performed element-wise. Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ""d"" sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).
",3166
"This compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the row-column algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ""d"" one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ""n"" dimension, then along the ""n"" dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(""N"" log ""N"") complexity, where formula_29 is the total number of data points transformed.
",3167
"To verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(""N"" log ""N"") time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Ergün, 1995).
",3168
"In more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for cache locality to group the dimensions recursively. For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar ""slice"" for each fixed ""n"", and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ""n"" direction. More generally, an asymptotically optimal cache-oblivious algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups formula_33 and formula_34 that are transformed recursively (rounding if ""d"" is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).
",3169
"Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(""N"" log ""N"") complexity. Yet another variation is to perform matrix transpositions in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for out-of-core and distributed memory situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.
",3170
"There are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(""N"" log ""N"") complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the vector-radix FFT algorithm, which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley–Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector formula_35 of radices at each step.

"The fast folding algorithm is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values.

"Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a non-uniform discrete Fourier transform, or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately).

" Zaïre (; ""The Tragedy of Zara"") is a five-act tragedy in verse by Voltaire. Written in three weeks, it was given its first public performance on 13 August 1732 by the Comédie française in Paris. It was a great success with the Paris audiences and marked a turning away from tragedies caused by a fatal flaw in the protagonist's character to ones based on pathos. The tragic fate of its heroine is caused not through any fault of her own, but by the jealousy of her Muslim lover and the intolerance of her fellow Christians.

" Many words in the English vocabulary are of French origin, most coming from the Anglo-Norman spoken by the upper classes in England for several hundred years after the Norman Conquest, before the language settled into what became Modern English. Thoroughly English words of French origin, such as ""art"", ""competition"", ""force"", ""machine"", ""money"", ""police"", ""publicity"", ""role"", ""routine"" and ""table"", are pronounced according to English rules of phonology, rather than French, and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin.

" Fly-by-wire (FBW) is a system that replaces the conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term) and flight control computers determine how to move the actuators at each control surface to provide the ordered response. It can use mechanical flight control backup systems (like the Boeing 777) or use fully fly-by-wire controls.
",3198
"Improved fully fly-by-wire systems interpret the pilot's control inputs as a desired outcome and calculate the control surface positions required to achieve that outcome; this results in various combinations of rudder, elevator, aileron, flaps and engine controls in different situations using a closed feedback loop. The pilot may not be fully aware of all the control outputs acting to effect the outcome, only that the aircraft is reacting as expected. The fly-by-wire computers act to stabilise the aircraft and adjust the flying characteristics without the pilot's involvement and to prevent the pilot operating outside of the aircraft's safe performance envelope.
",3199
"Mechanical and hydro-mechanical flight control systems are relatively heavy and require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of pulleys, cranks, tension cables and hydraulic pipes. Both systems often require redundant backup to deal with failures, which increases weight. Both have limited ability to compensate for changing aerodynamic conditions. Dangerous characteristics such as stalling, spinning and pilot-induced oscillation (PIO), which depend mainly on the stability and structure of the aircraft concerned rather than the control system itself, are dependent on pilot's action. The term ""fly-by-wire"" implies a purely electrically signaled control system.
",3200
"It is used in the general sense of computer-configured controls, where a computer system is interposed between the operator and the final control actuators or surfaces. This modifies the manual inputs of the pilot in accordance with control parameters. Side-sticks or conventional flight control yokes can be used to fly FBW aircraft. A FBW aircraft can be lighter than a similar design with conventional controls.
",3201
"This is partly due to the lower overall weight of the system components and partly because the natural stability of the aircraft can be relaxed, slightly for a transport aircraft, and more for a maneuverable fighter, which means that the stability surfaces that are part of the aircraft structure can therefore be made smaller. These include the vertical and horizontal stabilizers (fin and tailplane) that are (normally) at the rear of the fuselage. If these structures can be reduced in size, airframe weight is reduced. The advantages of FBW controls were first exploited by the military and then in the commercial airline market.

"The controllers at each surface receive these commands and then move actuators attached to the control surface until it has moved to where the flight control computer commanded it to. The controllers measure the position of the flight control surface with sensors such as LVDTs. Fly-by-wire control systems allow aircraft computers to perform tasks without pilot input. Automatic stability systems operate in this way. Gyroscopes fitted with sensors are mounted in an aircraft to sense rotation on the pitch, roll and yaw axes.
",3204
"Any movement (from straight and level flight for example) results in signals to the computer, which can automatically move control actuators to stabilize the aircraft. While traditional mechanical or hydraulic control systems usually fail gradually, the loss of all flight control computers immediately renders the aircraft uncontrollable. For this reason, most fly-by-wire systems incorporate either redundant computers (triplex, quadruplex etc. ), some kind of mechanical or hydraulic backup or a combination of both.
",3205
"A ""mixed"" control system with mechanical backup feedbacks any rudder elevation directly to the pilot and therefore makes closed loop (feedback) systems senseless. Aircraft systems may be quadruplexed (four independent channels) to prevent loss of signals in the case of failure of one or even two channels. High performance aircraft that have fly-by-wire controls (also called CCVs or Control-Configured Vehicles) may be deliberately designed to have low or even negative stability in some flight regimes rapid-reacting CCV controls can electronically stabilize the lack of natural stability.
",3206
"Pre-flight safety checks of a fly-by-wire system are often performed using built-in test equipment (BITE). A number of control movement steps can be automatically performed, reducing workload of the pilot or groundcrew and speeding up flight-checks. Some aircraft, the Panavia Tornado for example, retain a very basic hydro-mechanical backup system for limited flight control capability on losing electrical power; in the case of the Tornado this allows rudimentary control of the stabilators only for pitch and roll axis movements.

"This system also included solid-state components and system redundancy, was designed to be integrated with a computerised navigation and automatic search and track radar, was flyable from ground control with data uplink and downlink, and provided artificial feel (feedback) to the pilot.

",3209
"At about the same time in the United Kingdom a trainer variant of the British Hawker Hunter fighter was modified at the British Royal Aircraft Establishment with fly-by-wire flight controls for the right-seat pilot. All ""fly-by-wire"" flight control systems eliminate the complexity, the fragility and the weight of the mechanical circuit of the hydromechanical or electromechanical flight control systems — each being replaced with electronic circuits. The control mechanisms in the cockpit now operate signal transducers, which in turn generate the appropriate electronic commands.
",3210
"These are next processed by an electronic controller—either an analog one, or (more modernly) a digital one. Aircraft and spacecraft autopilots are now part of the electronic controller. The hydraulic circuits are similar except that mechanical servo valves are replaced with electrically controlled servo valves, operated by the electronic controller. This is the simplest and earliest configuration of an analog fly-by-wire flight control system. In this configuration, the flight control systems must simulate ""feel"". The electronic controller controls electrical feel devices that provide the appropriate ""feel"" forces on the manual controls.
",3211
"This was used in Concorde, the first production fly-by-wire airliner. In more sophisticated versions, analog computers replaced the electronic controller. The canceled 1950s Canadian supersonic interceptor, the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, employed this type of system. Analog computers also allowed some customization of flight control characteristics, including relaxed stability. This was exploited by the early versions of F-16, giving it impressive maneuverability. A digital fly-by-wire flight control system can be extended from its analog counterpart.
",3212
"Digital signal processing can receive and interpret input from multiple sensors simultaneously (such as the altimeters and the pitot tubes) and adjust the controls in real time. The computers sense position and force inputs from pilot controls and aircraft sensors. They then solve differential equations related to the aircraft's equations of motion to determine the appropriate command signals for the flight controls to execute the intentions of the pilot. The programming of the digital computers enable flight envelope protection. These protections are tailored to an aircraft's handling characteristics to stay within aerodynamic and structural limitations of the aircraft.

"Any safety-critical component in a digital fly-by-wire system including applications of the laws of aeronautics and computer operating systems will need to be certified to DO-178C Level A or B, depending on the class of aircraft, which is applicable for preventing potential catastrophic failures. Nevertheless, the top concern for computerized, digital, fly-by-wire systems is reliability, even more so than for analog electronic control systems. This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft's flight control surfaces.
",3215
"If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all fly-by-wire flight control systems are either triply or quadruply redundant in their computers and electronics. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel and three or four separate data buses connecting them with each control surface. The multiple redundant flight control computers continuously monitor each other's output.
",3216
"If one computer begins to give aberrant results for any reason, potentially including software or hardware failures or flawed input data, then the combined system is designed to exclude the results from that computer in deciding the appropriate actions for the flight controls. Depending on specific system details there may be the potential to reboot an aberrant flight control computer, or to reincorporate its inputs if they return to agreement. Complex logic exists to deal with multiple failures, which may prompt the system to revert to simpler back-up modes.

"This back-up system serves to reduce the risk of total flight-control-system failure ever happening because of a general-purpose flight software fault that has escaped notice in the other four computers.

"In addition, most of the early digital fly-by-wire aircraft also had an analog electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic back-up flight control system. The Space Shuttle has, in addition to its redundant set of four digital computers running its primary flight-control software, a fifth back-up computer running a separately developed, reduced-function, software flight-control system – one that can be commanded to take over in the event that a fault ever affects all of the computers in the other four.

Airbus and Boeing differ in their approaches to implementing fly-by-wire systems in commercial aircraft. Since the Airbus A320, Airbus flight-envelope control systems always retain ultimate flight control when flying under normal law and will not permit the pilots to violate aircraft performance limits unless they choose to fly under alternate law.
",3221
"In certain designs with limited relaxed stability in the pitch axis, for example the Boeing 777, the flight control system may allow the aircraft to fly at a more aerodynamically efficient angle of attack than a conventionally stable design. Modern airliners also commonly feature computerized Full-Authority Digital Engine Control systems (FADECs) that control their jet engines, air inlets, fuel storage and distribution system, in a similar fashion to the way that FBW controls the flight control surfaces. This allows the engine output to be continually varied for the most efficient usage possible.
",3222
"Boeing airliners, such as the Boeing 777, allow the pilots to completely override the computerised flight-control system, permitting the aircraft to be flown outside of its usual flight-control envelope if they decide that it is necessary. The advent of FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) engines permits operation of the flight control systems and autothrottles for the engines to be fully integrated. On modern military aircraft other systems such as autostabilization, navigation, radar and weapons system are all integrated with the flight control systems.

"The Kawasaki P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system. Having eliminated the mechanical transmission circuits in fly-by-wire flight control systems, the next step is to eliminate the bulky and heavy hydraulic circuits. The hydraulic circuit is replaced by an electrical power circuit. The power circuits power electrical or self-contained electrohydraulic actuators that are controlled by the digital flight control computers. All benefits of digital fly-by-wire are retained since the power-by-wire components are strictly complementary to the fly-by-wire components.
",3226
"Fly-by-wireless systems are very similar to fly-by-wire systems, however, instead of using a wired protocol for the physical layer a wireless protocol is employed. In addition to reducing weight, implementing a wireless solution has the potential to reduce costs throughout an aircraft's life cycle. For example, many key failure points associated with wire and connectors will be eliminated thus hours spent troubleshooting wires and connectors will be reduced. Furthermore, engineering costs could potentially decrease because less time would be spent on designing wiring installations, late changes in an aircraft's design would be easier to manage, etc.

"A newer flight control system, called intelligent flight control system (IFCS), is an extension of modern digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The aim is to intelligently compensate for aircraft damage and failure during flight, such as automatically using engine thrust and other avionics to compensate for severe failures such as loss of hydraulics, loss of rudder, loss of ailerons, loss of an engine, etc. Several demonstrations were made on a flight simulator where a Cessna-trained small-aircraft pilot successfully landed a heavily damaged full-size concept jet, without prior experience with large-body jet aircraft.

" In computer science, splaysort is an adaptive comparison sorting algorithm based on the splay tree data structure. The steps of the algorithm are: Thus, the algorithm may be seen as a form of insertion sort or tree sort, using a splay tree to speed up each insertion. Based on the amortized analysis of splay trees, the worst case running time of splaysort, on an input with ""n"" data items, is ""O""(""n"" log ""n""), matching the time bounds for efficient non-adaptive algorithms such as quicksort, heap sort, and merge sort.

"To quantify this, let ""d"" be the number of positions in the input that separate ""x"" from its predecessor, and let ""i"" be the number of items that appear on one side of ""x"" in the input and on the other side of ""x"" in the output (the number of inversions that involve ""x"").

In Rømer's scale, brine freezes at zero, water freezes and melts at 7.5 degrees, body temperature is 22.5, and water boils at 60 degrees. Fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and make the scale more fine-grained.

"He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power).

"If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different. Fermions are usually associated with matter, whereas bosons are generally force carrier particles, although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear. Weakly interacting fermions can also display bosonic behavior under extreme conditions. At low temperature fermions show superfluidity for uncharged particles and superconductivity for charged particles.

"Composite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, are the key building blocks of everyday matter.

",3331
"Examples include the following: The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion. Fermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances. At proximity, where spatial structure begins to be important, a composite particle (or system) behaves according to its constituent makeup. Fermions can exhibit bosonic behavior when they become loosely bound in pairs.

The analyst who provides the supervision is called a supervising analyst (or less frequently supervisory analyst).

The term ""supervised analysis"" is flexible. It can be applied to such treatment lasting over several years or to a single session; while even practicing analysts will sometimes seek supervision and discuss a challenging case with a senior colleague, or resort to ongoing supervision at times of analytic difficulty.

"In a speech in Dundee on 12 September, he proposed that England should also be governed by regional parliaments, with power devolved to areas such as Lancashire, Yorkshire, the Midlands and London as part of a federal system of government. In Europe, ""Federalist"" is sometimes used to describe those who favor a common federal government, with distributed power at regional, national and supranational levels. Most European federalists want this development to continue within the European Union. European federalism originated in post-war Europe; one of the more important initiatives was Winston Churchill's speech in Zürich in 1946.

"The U.S. Constitution was written as a reaction to the Articles of Confederation, under which the United States was a loose confederation with a weak central government. In contrast, Europe has a greater history of unitary states than North America, thus European ""federalism"" argues for a weaker central government, relative to a unitary state. The modern American usage of the word is much closer to the European sense. As the power of the Federal government has increased, some people have perceived a much more unitary state than they believe the Founding Fathers intended.

"For example, presbyterian church governance resembles parliamentary republicanism (a form of ""political federalism"") to a large extent. In Presbyterian denominations, the local church is ruled by elected elders, some of which are ministerial. Each church then sends representatives or commissioners to presbyteries and further to a general assembly. Each greater level of assembly has ruling authority over its constituent members. In this governmental structure, each component has some level of sovereignty over itself. As in ""political federalism"", in presbyterian ecclesiology there is shared sovereignty.

"Modern electric cars rely on power electronics for the main propulsion motor control, as well as managing the battery system. Future autonomous cars will rely on powerful computer systems, an array of sensors, networking, and satellite navigation, all of which will require electronics. The earliest electronic systems available as factory installations were vacuum tube car radios, starting in the early 1930s. The development of semiconductors after World War II greatly expanded the use of electronics in automobiles, with solid-state diodes making the automotive alternator the standard after about 1960, and the first transistorized ignition systems appearing about 1955.

"Engine controls demand one of the highest real-time deadlines, as the engine itself is a very fast and complex part of the automobile. Of all the electronics in any car, the computing power of the engine control unit is the highest, typically a 32-bit processor. A modern car may have up to 100 ECU's and a commercial vehicle up to 40. An engine ECU controls such functions as: In a diesel engine: In a gasoline engine: Many more engine parameters are actively monitored and controlled in real-time.
",3403
"There are about 20 to 50 that measure pressure, temperature, flow, engine speed, oxygen level and NOx level plus other parameters at different points within the engine. All these sensor signals are sent to the ECU, which has the logic circuits to do the actual controlling. The ECU output is connected to different actuators for the throttle valve, EGR valve, rack (in VGTs), fuel injector (using a pulse-width modulated signal), dosing injector and more. There are about 20 to 30 actuators in all.

"These control the transmission system, mainly the shifting of the gears for better shift comfort and to lower torque interrupt while shifting. Automatic transmissions use controls for their operation, and also many semi-automatic transmissions having a fully automatic clutch or a semi-auto clutch (declutching only). The engine control unit and the transmission control exchange messages, sensor signals and control signals for their operation.

"The chassis system has a lot of sub-systems which monitor various parameters and are actively controlled: These systems are always ready to act when there is a collision in progress or to prevent it when it senses a dangerous situation: All of the above systems form an infotainment system.

These are new generation hybrid ECUs that combine the functionalities of multiple ECUs of Infotainment Head Unit, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), Instrument Cluster, Rear Camera/Parking Assist, Surround View Systems etc.

"This saves on the cost of electronics as well as mechanical/physical parts like interconnects across ECUs etc. There is also a more centralized control so data can be seamlessly exchanged between the systems. There are of course challenges too. Given the complexity of this hybrid system, a lot more rigor is needed to validate the system for robustness, safety and security.

" Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to ""feed back"" into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems: Self-regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity, and the idea of feedback had started to enter economic theory in Britain by the 18th century, but it was not at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and so did not have a name.
",3434
"In 1788, James Watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner Matthew Boulton, for use in the steam engines of their production. Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion, and were used for pumping water – an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed, but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed. In 1868, James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper, ""On governors"", that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory. This was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback.
",3435
"The verb phrase ""to feed back"", in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process, was in use in the US by the 1860s, and in 1909, Nobel laureate Karl Ferdinand Braun used the term ""feed-back"" as a noun to refer to (undesired) coupling between components of an electronic circuit. By the end of 1912, researchers using early electronic amplifiers (audions) had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification (through regeneration), but would also cause the audion to howl or sing.
",3436
"This action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term ""feedback"" as a distinct word by 1920. Over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback. According to Ashby (1956), mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of ""circularity of action"", which keeps the theory simple and consistent. For those with more practical aims, feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection.
",3437
"Focusing on uses in management theory, Ramaprasad (1983) defines feedback generally as ""...information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter"" that is used to ""alter the gap in some way"". He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action. Positive feedback: If the signal fed back from output is in phase with the input signal, the feedback is called positive feedback. Negative feedback: If the signal fed back is of opposite polarity or out of phase by 180° with respect to input signal, the feedback is called as negative feedback.
",3438
"As an example of negative feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The controlled system is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. The error signal is the departure of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector).
",3439
"Harold Stephen Black's classic 1934 paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers. According to Black: According to Mindell (2002) confusion in the terms arose shortly after this: Even prior to the terms being applied, James Clerk Maxwell had described several kinds of ""component motions"" associated with the centrifugal governors used in steam engines, distinguishing between those that lead to a continual ""increase"" in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation, and those that lead to a ""decrease"" of the same. The terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines.
",3440
"Yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative, depending on how values are measured or referenced. This confusion may arise because feedback can be used for either ""informational"" or ""motivational"" purposes, and often has both a ""qualitative"" and a ""quantitative"" component. As Connellan and Zemke (1993) put it: While simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type, many systems with feedback loops cannot be so easily designated as simply positive or negative, and this is especially true when multiple loops are present.
",3441
"In general, feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system. The term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact, the output of one affecting the input of another, and vice versa. Some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic behaviors in non-linear systems, while others have much more predictable behaviors, such as those that are used to make and design digital systems. Feedback is used extensively in digital systems.
",3442
"For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it. By using feedback properties, the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application; systems can be made stable, responsive or held constant. It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the edge of chaos. In biological systems such as organisms, ecosystems, or the biosphere, most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions.

"We talked about it a lot all those nights in camp when we were too hungry or scared to sleep. We even talked to Cousin Bobby Lee about it.

Those weren't mere words to you. You took them seriously and you'll always hold to your oath, Timothy. I reckon that makes you a better soldier than I, maybe a better man. It makes me damn proud to be your brother.
",3444
"The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments. A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function. The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel. An example of this is insulin oscillations. Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits, both positive and negative. As in other contexts, ""positive"" and ""negative"" do not imply that the feedback causes ""good"" or ""bad"" effects.
",3445
"A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process, whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it. The mirror neurons are part of a social feedback system, when an observed action is ""mirrored"" by the brain—like a self-performed action. Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators; failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function.

"Repressor (see Lac repressor) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons, which were identified by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 as ""feedback loops"". These feedback loops may be positive (as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (as is often the case in metabolic consumption). On a larger scale, feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes, although time lags in feedback response can give rise to predator-prey cycles.

"When they realize that they are blushing, they become even more embarrassed, which leads to further blushing, and so on. The climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere, ocean, and land. A simple example is the ice-albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground (of lower albedo), which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt. Feedback is extensively used in control theory, using a variety of methods including state space (controls), full state feedback, and so forth.
",3449
"Note that in the context of control theory, ""feedback"" is traditionally assumed to specify ""negative feedback"". The most common general-purpose controller using a control-loop feedback mechanism is a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Heuristically, the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time: the proportional term depends on the ""present"" error, the integral term on the accumulation of ""past"" errors, and the derivative term is a prediction of ""future"" error, based on current rate of change. For feedback in the educational context, see corrective feedback.

"In an injured or infected tissue, inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells, which alter gene expression, and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted, including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function. This type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries. During cancer, key elements of this feedback fail. This disrupts tissue function and immunity. Mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria, where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions. Feedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks.

"The ""Great Eastern"" was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in 1866 by John McFarlane Gray. Joseph Farcot coined the word ""servo"" in 1873 to describe steam-powered steering systems. Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns. Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in 1912. Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in 1922 and described the PID controller.

"Internal combustion engines of the late 20th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum timing advance but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small, robust and powerful single-chip microcontrollers became affordable. The use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such as amplifiers, oscillators, and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip-flops and counters. Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical, thermal and other physical processes.
",3454
"If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop, the system is said to have ""negative feedback""; otherwise, the feedback is said to be ""positive"". Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes. This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it. When this happens, the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in over-correction, causing the output to oscillate or ""hunt"".
",3455
"While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour, this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators. Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs derived the Nyquist stability criterion for determining the stability of feedback systems. An easier method, but less general, is to use Bode plots developed by Hendrik Bode to determine the gain margin and phase margin. Design to ensure stability often involves frequency compensation to control the location of the poles of the amplifier. Electronic feedback loops are used to control the output of electronic devices, such as amplifiers. A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input.
",3456
"A device is said to be operating ""open loop"" if no output feedback is being employed and ""closed loop"" if feedback is being used. When two or more amplifiers are cross-coupled using positive feedback, complex behaviors can be created. These ""multivibrators"" are widely used and include: A Negative feedback occurs when the fed-back output signal has a relative phase of 180° with respect to the input signal (upside down). This situation is sometimes referred to as being ""out of phase"", but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations, as in ""90° out of phase"".
",3457
"Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations. In feedback amplifiers, this correction is generally for waveform distortion reduction or to establish a specified gain level. A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the asymptotic gain model. Positive feedback occurs when the fed-back signal is in phase with the input signal. Under certain gain conditions, positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states. Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit.

"Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games. Oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal: Oscillators designed to produce a high-power AC output from a DC supply are usually called inverters. There are two main types of electronic oscillator: the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator.

"A latch or a flip-flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. Latches and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems. Latches and flip-flops are used as data storage elements.
",3461
"Such data storage can be used for storage of ""state"", and such a circuit is described as sequential logic. When used in a finite-state machine, the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal. Flip-flops can be either simple (transparent or opaque) or clocked (synchronous or edge-triggered).
",3462
"Although the term flip-flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits, in modern usage it is common to reserve the term ""flip-flop"" exclusively for discussing clocked circuits; the simple ones are commonly called ""latches"". Using this terminology, a latch is level-sensitive, whereas a flip-flop is edge-sensitive. That is, when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent, while a flip flop's output only changes on a single type (positive going or negative going) of clock edge.

"Feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running, maintenance, and evolution of software and computing systems. Feedback-loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process, to guarantee system properties at run-time. Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems. In particular, they have been applied to the development of products such as IBM's Universal Database server and IBM Tivoli.

"From a software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems. Feedback is also a useful design principle for designing user interfaces. Video feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic feedback. It involves a loop between a video camera input and a video output, e.g., a television screen or monitor. Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback.

"The stock market is an example of a system prone to oscillatory ""hunting"", governed by positive and negative feedback resulting from cognitive and emotional factors among market participants. For example: George Soros used the word ""reflexivity,"" to describe feedback in the financial markets and developed an investment theory based on this principle. The conventional economic equilibrium model of supply and demand supports only ideal linear negative feedback and was heavily criticized by Paul Ormerod in his book ""The Death of Economics"", which, in turn, was criticized by traditional economists.

"Furigana fonts are generally sized so that two kana characters fit naturally over one kanji; when more kana are required, this is resolved either by adjusting the furigana by using a condensed font (narrowing the kana), or by adjusting the kanji by intercharacter spacing (adding spaces around the kanji). In case an isolated kanji character has a long reading—for example (where reads , ""tazusa"")—the furigana may instead spill over into the space next to the neighboring kana characters, without condensing or changing spacing.
",3472
"These cause severe spacing problems due to length and these words being used as units (hence closely associated with the preceding figure). When it is necessary to distinguish between native Japanese ""kun'yomi"" pronunciations and Chinese-derived ""on'yomi"" pronunciations, for example in kanji dictionaries, the Japanese pronunciations are written in hiragana, and the Chinese pronunciations are written in katakana.

"The distinction between regular kana and the smaller character forms (yōon and sokuon), which are used in regular orthography to mark such things as gemination and palatalization, is often not made in furigana: for example, the usual hiragana spelling of the word (""kyakka"") is , but in furigana it might be written .

"His pioneering work with the application of lead and oxygen isotope analysis in archaeology led him occasionally to add the investigation of metal objects to his portfolio so that, together, his published works number more than 160 (Brill and Wampler 1967). Perhaps the most famous of these is his ""Chemical Analyses of Early Glass"", a sum of his 39 years of work and now a seminal reference guide in the field (Brill 1999). Brill is a strong proponent of interdisciplinary cooperation as well as the collaboration between scientists across the world, and has served since 1982 on the International Commission on Glass.

The 1960s saw Brill beginning to develop the analytical techniques that would define the early years of his career at Corning, and yet the scope of his interest within glass remained vast.

"Indeed, 1961 saw Brill pen a letter to Nature with a colleague, that was a ‘bombshell’, according to Newton, in the field of glass-dating (1971, 3). Here Brill suggested that the rather enigmatic weathering crust found to form on buried glass objects over time could be used to date the object in a method rather similar to dendrochronology, using the separate layers of the shiny lamination (Brill 1961, Brill and Hood 1961, Newton 1971).
",3500
"Whilst in dendrochronology the tree-rings account simply for the tree's annual growth, in the weathering crust on glass Brill suggested the accumulation of a layer of laminate might respond to some kind of annual event of climatic change (Brill 1961). Unfortunately, despite the examples of the method's successful applications provided by Brill, such as the almost accurate count of 156 layers on a bottle-base from the York River submerged in 1781 and excavated in 1935, the technique largely failed to convince and did not see widespread adoption (Brill 1961, Newton 1971).
",3501
"The most important of these techniques would prove to be Brill's pioneering application of lead isotope analysis, hitherto used only in geology, to archaeological objects. Brill first presented this idea at the 1965 Seminar in Examination of Works of Art, held at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, but the first widely published account of the method seems to be Brill and Wampler's 1967 article in the ""American Journal of Archaeology"".
",3502
"Here, Brill and Wampler outlined how the technique could be used to provenance the lead contents of archaeological objects to lead ore sources around the world, based on the isotopic signature of various leads, which relates them to ‘ores occurring in different geographical areas’ (1967, 63). These different areas have different signatures because they are of varying geological age, something reflected by the individual lead isotopes which form only after the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium (Brill et al. 1965, Brill and Wampler 1967).
",3503
"While the lead isotope ratios used for provenancing are different, they are not unique: areas geologically similar will yield similar lead isotope signatures (Brill 1970). Furthermore, if leads were salvaged and mixed in ancient times, the isotope ratio will be compromised (Brill 1970). Aside from these two limitations, there is little else that could affect the lead isotope reading an object would yield. As such, Brill's method was greeted enthusiastically and he went on to develop the technique, as well as oxygen isotope analysis, in his 1970 publication.
",3504
"Here he demonstrated how the technique could be used both to classify early glasses and to a certain extent characterize the ingredients from which they were made (1970, 143). Returning to 1965, this year saw Brill launch another important innovation in glass analysis, the comparison of interlaboratory experiments in order to verify analytical results (Brill 1965). ‘Originally inspired by a plea from W E S Turner’, according to Freestone, Brill first mooted his idea at the ""VIIth International Congress on Glass"", in Brussels (Brill 1965a, I. Freestone, ""pers. comm.""

"2009). It wasn’t until the ""VIIIth International Congress on Glass"" in 1968, however, that Brill fully launched his concept of an ‘analytical round robin’, having distributed a number of reference glasses to be tested in different laboratories using a range of current techniques including X-ray fluorescence and neutron activation analysis (1968, 49). When discussing his motive for the experiment, Brill aptly stated: 'The truth is that the chemical analysis of glasses is a difficult undertaking and still remains in some senses an art' (1968, 49).
",3506
"By conducting the round robin experiment, Brill hoped the results gathered from different laboratories would help ‘correlate [...] earlier results’ and ‘calibrate future analyses in reference to one another’, as well as suggest which out of the analytical procedures used was the most accurate and effective (1968, 49). The results of the round robin were presented at the 'IXth International Congress on Glass' in 1971, and showed that, as Brill suspected, there was poor agreement between certain identified elements, and therefore these might be ‘troublesome’ generally across analyses (1971, 97).
",3507
"These included calcium, aluminium, lead and barium, among others (Brill 1971). Aside from their correctional potential, the results, from 45 different laboratories in 15 countries, also provided an enormous data set from which, Brill suggested, the participants could ‘evaluate their own methods and procedures against the findings of other analysts’ (1971, 97).
",3508
"At the time, Brill could hardly have suspected that the data would go on to have such great import, but Croegaard's generation of preferred glass compositions, from statistical analysis of the data, were used successfully by many people until Brill's own reference guide was published in 1999 (I. Freestone, 'pers. comm. ', 2009).

" Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is a form of luminescence. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. The most striking example of fluorescence occurs when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, while the emitted light is in the visible region, which gives the fluorescent substance a distinct color that can be seen only when exposed to UV light.
",3510
"Its most common everyday application is in energy-saving fluorescent lamps and LED lamps, where fluorescent coatings are used to convert short-wavelength UV light or blue light into longer-wavelength yellow light, thereby mimicking the warm light of energy-inefficient incandescent lamps. Fluorescence also occurs frequently in nature in some minerals and in various biological forms in many branches of the animal kingdom.
",3511
"In 1819, Edward D. Clarke and in 1822 René Just Haüy described fluorescence in fluorites, Sir David Brewster described the phenomenon for chlorophyll in 1833 and Sir John Herschel did the same for quinine in 1845. In his 1852 paper on the ""Refrangibility"" (wavelength change) of light, George Gabriel Stokes described the ability of fluorspar and uranium glass to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into blue light.

"Other rates of excited state decay are caused by mechanisms other than photon emission and are, therefore, often called ""non-radiative rates"", which can include: dynamic collisional quenching, near-field dipole-dipole interaction (or resonance energy transfer), internal conversion, and intersystem crossing. Thus, if the rate of any pathway changes, both the excited state lifetime and the fluorescence quantum yield will be affected. Fluorescence quantum yields are measured by comparison to a standard. The quinine salt ""quinine sulfate"" in a sulfuric acid solution is a common fluorescence standard.

"In a key experiment he used a prism to isolate ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and observed blue light emitted by an ethanol solution of quinine exposed by it. Fluorescence occurs when an excited molecule, atom, or nanostructure, relaxes to a lower energy state (possibly the ground state) through emission of a photon.

"In such case the total decay rate is the sum over all rates: where formula_18 is the total decay rate, formula_19 the radiative decay rate and formula_20 the non-radiative decay rate. It is similar to a first-order chemical reaction in which the first-order rate constant is the sum of all of the rates (a parallel kinetic model). If the rate of spontaneous emission, or any of the other rates are fast, the lifetime is short.

"For commonly used fluorescent compounds, typical excited state decay times for photon emissions with energies from the UV to near infrared are within the range of 0.5 to 20 nanoseconds. The fluorescence lifetime is an important parameter for practical applications of fluorescence such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy. The Jablonski diagram describes most of the relaxation mechanisms for excited state molecules. The diagram alongside shows how fluorescence occurs due to the relaxation of certain excited electrons of a molecule.
",3517
"The ending state S, if not the ground state, may then lose its remaining energy through further fluorescent emission and/or ""non-radiative relaxation"" in which the energy is dissipated as heat (phonons). When the excited state is a metastable (long-lived) state, then that fluorescent transition is rather termed phosphorescence. Relaxation from an excited state can also occur through transferring some or all of its energy to a second molecule through an interaction known as fluorescence quenching.
",3518
"It is generally thought to be related to the high brightness of the color relative to what it would be as a component of white. Fluorescence shifts energy in the incident illumination from shorter wavelengths to longer (such as blue to yellow) and thus can make the fluorescent color appear brighter (more saturated) than it could possibly be by reflection alone. There are several general rules that deal with fluorescence. Each of the following rules has exceptions but they are useful guidelines for understanding fluorescence (these rules do not necessarily apply to two-photon absorption).

"528 of the museum's objects were damaged, the library's rare books were ruined and paper index systems, data and catalogues were all lost (Martin and Edwards 1977). In the wake of this destruction, Brill was named Director, so that his time holding this position, from 1972-1975, would be spent overseeing the complete restoration of the museum. Buechner praises how Brill 'painstakingly' prepared the insurance claim that would support the museum throughout the renovation process and facilitate the replacement of many wonderful objects (1977, 7).

"Kasha's rule dictates that the quantum yield of luminescence is independent of the wavelength of exciting radiation. This occurs because excited molecules usually decay to the lowest vibrational level of the excited state before fluorescence emission takes place. The Kasha–Vavilov rule does not always apply and is violated severely in many simple molecules. A somewhat more reliable statement, although still with exceptions, would be that the fluorescence spectrum shows very little dependence on the wavelength of exciting radiation. For many fluorophores the absorption spectrum is a mirror image of the emission spectrum.
",3521
"The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state. There are many natural compounds that exhibit fluorescence, and they have a number of applications. Some deep-sea animals, such as the greeneye, have fluorescent structures.
",3522
"Fluorescence is the temporary absorption of electromagnetic wavelengths from the visible light spectrum by fluorescent molecules, and the subsequent emission of light at a lower energy level. When it occurs in a living organism, it is sometimes called biofluorescence. This causes the light that is emitted to be a different color than the light that is absorbed. Stimulating light excites an electron, raising energy to an unstable level. This instability is unfavorable, so the energized electron is returned to a stable state almost as immediately as it becomes unstable.
",3523
"This return to stability corresponds with the release of excess energy in the form of fluorescence light. This emission of light is only observable when the stimulant light is still providing light to the organism/object and is typically yellow, pink, orange, red, green, or purple. Fluorescence is often confused with the following forms of biotic light, bioluminescence and biophosphorescence. Pumpkin toadlets that live in the Brazilian Atlantic forest are fluorescent.

"Whilst work at Beth She’Arim had eventually found there to be five firing chambers responsible for heating the one tank, the fragmentary remains at Jalame made it very difficult to interpret the furnace set-up, apart from the fact that they believed there to have been only one firing chamber (Brill 1988). In the late eighties Brill was to contribute various studies to the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, following the excavation of a number of exciting shipwrecks including the ""Serçe Liman"", and the ""Ulu Burun"" (Barnes et al. 1986, Brill 1989).

"Here Brill's own technique of lead isotope analysis was to provide a means for provenancing items aboard ship, and thus determine the ship's origin and her ports-of-call. The excavators of the ""Serçe Liman"" wanted to know whether she was Byzantine or Islamic, a complicated question for lead isotope analysis as the lead ores of the Eastern Mediterranean share geographical characteristics and therefore overlap (Barnes et al. 1986).
",3526
"Using 900 lead net sinkers divided into six loose groupings, Brill found groups III, V and VI to be Byzantine, that is with ores found in modern-day Turkey (Barnes et al. 1986). Group I, however, was taken to be most indicative of the ship's origin; this group contained net sinkers, but also two ceramic glazes and three glass vessels, all sharing virtually identical lead ores with only one isotopic match, ‘an ore from Anguran, northwest of Tehran’ according to Barnes et al. (1986, 7).
",3527
"Pigment cells that exhibit fluorescence are called fluorescent chromatophores, and function somatically similar to regular chromatophores. These cells are dendritic, and contain pigments called fluorosomes. These pigments contain fluorescent proteins which are activated by K+ (potassium) ions, and it is their movement, aggregation, and dispersion within the fluorescent chromatophore that cause directed fluorescence patterning. Fluorescent cells are innervated the same as other chromatophores, like melanophores, pigment cells that contain melanin.
",3528
"This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the Franck–Condon principle which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state. In general, emitted fluorescence light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, is due to energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed and when a new one is emitted.

"Light intensity decreases 10 fold with every 75 m of depth, so at depths of 75 m, light is 10% as intense as it is on the surface, and is only 1% as intense at 150 m as it is on the surface. Because the water filters out the wavelengths and intensity of water reaching certain depths, different proteins, because of the wavelengths and intensities of light they are capable of absorbing, are better suited to different depths.

"Brill had greater success in differentiating between Chinese glass samples when using lead isotope analysis, a method that has proven effective in the first instance of identifying Chinese glass as the leads used here are different from those anywhere else in the world (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). Brill found his Chinese samples to fall into two distinct groups, possessing on one hand the highest, and on the other the lowest, lead isotope ratios he had ""ever"" encountered (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991).
",3532
"As such, he was able to show that despite the striking similarity in the glasses’ chemical composition and appearance, the ores from which their leads were sourced must have been from very geologically-different mines (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991).
",3533
"One reason for this is that glass was never produced in the East in such great quantities as it was in the West but also that archaeological Chinese glasses are often prone to problems (Brill 1991). The difficulties of analysing Chinese glasses were reflected later in the publication where, following the chemical investigation of 71 samples, Brill found that identifying the ‘basic formulation’, or ‘any of the primary batch materials’ of the glasses was still almost impossible (Brill et al. 1991).

"Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes function as long-pass filters. These filters enable the species that to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence, in order to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fish that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing fluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it. Fluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage. Many of these lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.
",3535
"Theoretically, some fish eyes can detect light as deep as 1000 m. At these depths of the aphotic zone, the only sources of light are organisms themselves, giving off light through chemical reactions in a process called bioluminescence. Fluorescence is simply defined as the absorption of electromagnetic radiation at one wavelength and its reemission at another, lower energy wavelength. Thus any type of fluorescence depends on the presence of external sources of light. Biologically functional fluorescence is found in the photic zone, where there is not only enough light to cause fluorescence, but enough light for other organisms to detect it.

"Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs. Spiders fluoresce under UV light and possess a huge diversity of fluorophores. Remarkably, spiders are the only known group in which fluorescence is “taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily labile, and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling"". A study by Andrews et al. (2007) reveals that fluorescence has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification.
",3546
"In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species. Scorpions also fluorescent due to the presence of beta carboline in their cuticles. The ""Mirabilis jalapa"" flower contains violet, fluorescent betacyanins and yellow, fluorescent betaxanthins.
",3547
"Under white light, parts of the flower containing only betaxanthins appear yellow, but in areas where both betaxanthins and betacyanins are present, the visible fluorescence of the flower is faded due to internal light-filtering mechanisms. Fluorescence was previously suggested to play a role in pollinator attraction, however, it was later found that the visual signal by fluorescence is negligible compared to the visual signal of light reflected by the flower. Chlorophyll is probably the most widely distributed fluorescent molecule, producing red emission under a range of excitation wavelengths.

"Fluorescence in minerals is caused by a wide range of activators.

"Improvements since then have largely been better phosphors, longer life, and more consistent internal discharge, and easier-to-use shapes (such as compact fluorescent lamps). Some high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps couple their even-greater electrical efficiency with phosphor enhancement for better color rendition.

"The combination of the blue light that continues through the phosphor and the green to red fluorescence from the phosphors produces a net emission of white light. Glow sticks sometimes utilize fluorescent materials to absorb light from the chemiluminescent reaction and emit light of a different color. Many analytical procedures involve the use of a fluorometer, usually with a single exciting wavelength and single detection wavelength. Because of the sensitivity that the method affords, fluorescent molecule concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion can be measured.

"Fluorescence in several wavelengths can be detected by an array detector, to detect compounds from HPLC flow. Also, TLC plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent. Fluorescence is most effective when there is a larger ratio of atoms at lower energy levels in a Boltzmann distribution. There is, then, a higher probability of excitement and release of photons by lower-energy atoms, making analysis more efficient. Usually the setup of a fluorescence assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light.
",3558
"In general, a single wavelength is required for proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation monochromator, and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to Stokes shift and various electron transitions. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission monochromator, and observed selectively by a detector.

" In classical mechanics, Euler's laws of motion are equations of motion which extend Newton's laws of motion for point particle to rigid body motion. They were formulated by Leonhard Euler about 50 years after Isaac Newton formulated his laws. Euler's first law states that the linear momentum of a body, (also denoted ) is equal to the product of the mass of the body and the velocity of its center of mass : Internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body as there is an equal and opposite force resulting in no net effect.
",3597
"Euler's second law states that the rate of change of angular momentum (sometimes denoted ) about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame (often the mass center of the body), is equal to the sum of the external moments of force (torques) acting on that body (also denoted or ) about that point: Note that the above formula holds only if both and are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial frame but fixed on the center of mass.
",3598
"For rigid bodies translating and rotating in only two dimensions, this can be expressed as: where is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point about which moments are summed, is the angular acceleration of the body about its center of mass, and is the moment of inertia of the body about its center of mass. See also Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics). The distribution of internal forces in a deformable body are not necessarily equal throughout, i.e. the stresses vary from one point to the next.
",3599
"This variation of internal forces throughout the body is governed by Newton's second law of motion of conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum, which for their simplest use are applied to a mass particle but are extended in continuum mechanics to a body of continuously distributed mass. For continuous bodies these laws are called Euler's laws of motion. If a body is represented as an assemblage of discrete particles, each governed by Newton's laws of motion, then Euler's equations can be derived from Newton's laws.

"Euler's equations can, however, be taken as axioms describing the laws of motion for extended bodies, independently of any particle distribution. The total body force applied to a continuous body with mass , mass density , and volume , is the volume integral integrated over the volume of the body: where is the force acting on the body per unit mass (dimensions of acceleration, misleadingly called the ""body force""), and is an infinitesimal mass element of the body. Body forces and contact forces acting on the body lead to corresponding moments (torques) of those forces relative to a given point.

"Through the use of modulators with frequencies that are non-integer multiples of the carrier signal (i.e. inharmonic), inharmonic bell-like and percussive spectra can be created. FM synthesis using analog oscillators may result in pitch instability. However, FM synthesis can also be implemented digitally, which is more stable and became standard practice. Digital FM synthesis (implemented as phase modulation) was the basis of several musical instruments beginning as early as 1974. Yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in 1974, based on FM synthesis, before commercially releasing the Yamaha GS-1 in 1980.

" Frequency modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis) is a form of sound synthesis whereby the frequency of a waveform is changed by modulating its frequency with a modulator. The frequency of an oscillator is altered ""in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal"". FM synthesis can create both harmonic and inharmonic sounds. To synthesize harmonic sounds, the modulating signal must have a harmonic relationship to the original carrier signal. As the amount of frequency modulation increases, the sound grows progressively complex.

"FM synthesis was developed in the 1960s at Stanford University, California, by John Chowning, who was trying to create sounds different from analog synthesis. His algorithm was licensed to Japanese company Yamaha in 1973. The implementation commercialized by Yamaha (US Patent 4018121 Apr 1977 or U.S. Patent 4,018,121) is actually based on phase modulation, but the results end up being equivalent mathematically as both are essentially a special case of quadrature amplitude modulation.

"Yamaha's engineers began adapting Chowning's algorithm for use in a commercial digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the ""key scaling"" method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation, though it would take several years before Yamaha released their FM digital synthesizers. In the 1970s, Yamaha were granted a number of patents, under the company's former name ""Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha"", evolving Chowning's work. Yamaha built the first prototype FM digital synthesizer in 1974.

"Casio developed a related form of synthesis called phase distortion synthesis, used in its CZ range of synthesizers. It had a similar (but slightly differently derived) sound quality to the DX series. Don Buchla implemented FM on his instruments in the mid-1960s, prior to Yamaha's patent. His 158, 258 and 259 dual oscillator modules had a specific FM control voltage input, and the model 208 (Music Easel) had a modulation oscillator hard-wired to allow FM as well as AM of the primary oscillator.

"FM today is mostly found in software-based synths such as FM8 by Native Instruments or Sytrus by Image-Line, but it has also been incorporated into the synthesis repertoire of some modern digital synthesizers, usually coexisting as an option alongside other methods of synthesis such as subtractive, sample-based synthesis, additive synthesis, and other techniques.

"These two types of wave forms can be used to model the basic harmonic peaks in the bottom of the harmonic spectrum of most instruments. The Res1 and Res2 wave forms move the spectral peak to a specific harmonic and can be used to model either triangular or rounded groups of harmonics further up in the spectrum of an instrument. Combining an All1 or Odd1 wave form with multiple Res1 (or Res2) wave forms (and adjusting their amplitudes) can model the harmonic spectrum of an instrument or sound. Combining sets of 8 FM operators with multi-spectral wave forms began in 1999 by Yamaha in the FS1R.

"The FS1R had 16 operators, 8 standard FM operators and 8 additional operators that used a noise source rather than an oscillator as its sound source. By adding in tuneable noise sources the FS1R could model the sounds produced in the human voice and in a wind instrument, along with making percussion instrument sounds. The FS1R also contained an additional wave form called the Formant wave form.

"The wall allows the diatoms to sink to avoid light inhibition or nutrient limitations, as well as to protect against grazing zooplankton. The silica frustules also contribute vastly to the sediment layers of the earth and to the fossil record, which makes them exceptionally useful in increasing understanding of numerous processes such as gauging the degree of climate change. Before sinking to the ocean floor, every atom of silicon that enters the ocean is integrated into the cell wall of a diatom about 40 times.

"There are two parts of the Fermi paradox that rely on empirical evidence—that there are many potential habitable planets, and that we see no evidence of life. The first point, that many suitable planets exist, was an assumption in Fermi's time but is now supported by the discovery that exoplanets are common. Current models predict billions of habitable worlds in our galaxy. The second part of the paradox, that we see no evidence of extraterrestrial life, is also an active field of scientific research. This includes both efforts to find any indication of life, and efforts specifically directed to finding intelligent life.

"A resting cell is better able to rapidly respond when nutrients become available again. This is more often observed in freshwater and pennate diatoms like ""Pseudo-nitzschia"". There is contradictory evidence regarding the presence or absence of a resting stage in ""Pseudo-nitzschia"". Among diatoms, reproduction is primarily asexual by binary fission, with each daughter cell receiving one of the parent’s cell’s two frustules. However, this asexual division results in a size reduction. To restore the cell size of a diatom population, sexual reproduction must occur.
",3659
"The basic mode of the sexual phase of reproduction appears to be conserved among ""Pseudo-nitzschia"" species. Upon mixing two strains of compatible mating type and of appropriate cell size for sexualization, cells align side by side and differentiate into gametangia. One active (+) and one passive (-) gamete are then produced within each gametangium. The active gamete migrates toward the passive partner and conjugates. The zygote is then becomes an auxospore, which has no rigid frustule. Inside the auxospore, a large initial cell is produced.
",3660
"Sexual reproduction appears to occur exclusively in the exponential growth phase and be linked to cell density. Sexualization can only be initiated when a species-specific threshold cell concentration is met. Decreasing the distance to facilitate contact and/or perception of chemical cues between cells triggers the sexual phase, indicating that high cell density is favorable for sexual reproduction. Additionally, the onset of sexualization is linked to a significant reduction in growth of the vegetative and parental cells, suggesting that vegetative division is inhibited when the two strains of opposite mating type come in contact.

"Another speculation for contact with an alien probe—one that would be trying to find human beings—is an alien Bracewell probe. Such a hypothetical device would be an autonomous space probe whose purpose is to seek out and communicate with alien civilizations (as opposed to von Neumann probes, which are usually described as purely exploratory). These were proposed as an alternative to carrying a slow speed-of-light dialogue between vastly distant neighbors. Rather than contending with the long delays a radio dialogue would suffer, a probe housing an artificial intelligence would seek out an alien civilization to carry on a close-range communication with the discovered civilization.
",3663
"The findings of such a probe would still have to be transmitted to the home civilization at light speed, but an information-gathering dialogue could be conducted in real time. Direct exploration of the Solar System has yielded no evidence indicating a visit by aliens or their probes.

"However, in 2018, observations determined that the amount of dimming varied by the frequency of the light, pointing to dust, rather than an opaque object such as a Dyson sphere, as the culprit for causing the dimming. Those who think that intelligent extraterrestrial life is (nearly) impossible argue that the conditions needed for the evolution of life—or at least the evolution of biological complexity—are rare or even unique to Earth. Under this assumption, called the rare Earth hypothesis, a rejection of the mediocrity principle, complex multicellular life is regarded as exceedingly unusual.

"It is possible that even if complex life is common, intelligence (and consequently civilizations) is not. While there are remote sensing techniques that could perhaps detect life-bearing planets without relying on the signs of technology, none of them has any ability to tell if any detected life is intelligent.

Extraterrestrials might, for example, transmit signals that have a very high or low data rate, or employ unconventional (in our terms) frequencies, which would make them hard to distinguish from background noise. Signals might be sent from non-main sequence star systems that we search with lower priority; current programs assume that most alien life will be orbiting Sun-like stars.

"Such signals could be detected at ranges of hundreds to tens of thousands of light-years distance. However, this means that detectors must be listening to an appropriate range of frequencies, and be in that region of space to which the beam is being sent.

"The whole period of modern human existence to date is a very brief period on a cosmological scale, and radio transmissions have only been propagated since 1895.

"Density is more important for refiners since it represents the yield after distillation. However, no relationship links the two. Oil reservoirs exist at varying depths and temperatures. Although viscosity varies significantly with temperature, density is the standard in oilfield classification. Crude oil density is commonly expressed in degrees of American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity which are associated with specific gravity. The lower the API gravity, the denser the oil. The API gravity of liquid crude oil ranges from 4º for tar rich in bitumen to condensates that have an API gravity of 70º.

"Heavy oils are classified between ultra-heavy oils and light oils. They have API gravities ranging between 10º and 20º. Crude oil generated by petroleum source rocks has an API gravity of between 30º and 40º. Crude oil becomes heavy after considerable degradation, after entrapment and during devolatilization. Degradation occurs through chemical and biological processes when oil reservoirs become contaminated by bacteria through subsurface water. The bacteria then break down some crude oil components into heavy components, making it more viscous. Water carries away low molecular weight hydrocarbons in solution form since they are more soluble.

"This causes low sweep efficiency and early water production with the volume of oil in contact with the water. Sweep efficiency is the measure of the effectiveness of an EOR method that depends on the total volume of the reservoir that the injected fluid contacts. Sweep efficiency is affected by multiple factors: mobility ratio, directional permeability, cumulative water injected, flood pattern, geological heterogeneity and distribution of pressure between injectors and producers. Displacement efficiency is the fraction of oil that is recovered from a zone that has been swept by a steam injection or any other displacement method.

"This attenuation is usually based on velocity dispersion. Studies show seismic wave reflection between an elastic overburden and an equivalent medium have coefficients of reflection that vary with frequency. This variation, depends on the behavior of AVO at the interface. The calculation of synthetic seismographs for the ideal model is carried out using the reflectivity technique for those materials whose velocities and attenuations are frequency dependent. This is usually used since the effects of velocity and attenuation variations are detectable on stacked data. Improved spectral decomposition techniques have shown the frequency dependent parameters more clearly.

"The zoo hypothesis may break down under the uniformity of motive flaw: all it takes is a single culture or civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be abrogated, and the probability of such a violation of hegemony increases with the number of civilizations, tending not towards a 'Galactic Club' with a unified foreign policy with regard to life on Earth but multiple 'Galactic Cliques'.

"Over time the artificial pressure loses efficacy because the remaining (heavy) oil is too viscous to flow and is held by sandstone in the reservoirs. The two cold production recovery methods have a combination recovery factor of between 10 and 20 percent depending on the oil properties and types of rocks. Tertiary recovery is commonly known as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). It is the method of producing oil after the primary and secondary stages have extracted most of the oil in a reserve. Specifically, enhanced oil recovery is used to recover oil trapped in porous rocks and the heavy oil that is too viscous to flow.

This assumption is not always met because interaction is inevitable and the surface energy is usually changed because of it.

" In the field of computer security, independent researchers often discover flaws in software that can be abused to cause unintended behaviour; these flaws are called vulnerabilities. The process by which the analysis of these vulnerabilities is shared with third parties is the subject of much debate, and is referred to as the researcher's ""disclosure policy"". Full disclosure is the practice of publishing analysis of software vulnerabilities as early as possible, making the data accessible to everyone without restriction.

"The non-interaction zone in Ramsey's model can be made much longer than the one interaction zone in Rabi's method because there is no perpendicular field formula_33 being applied in the non-interaction zone (although there is still The Hamiltonian in the rotating frame for the two interaction zones is the same for that of the Rabi method, and in the non-interaction zone the Hamiltonian is only the formula_38 term.

"By making the two interaction zones very short, the atoms spend a much shorter time in the presence of the external electromagnetic fields than they would in the Rabi model. This is advantageous because the longer the atoms are in the interaction zone, the more inhomogeneities (such as an inhomogeneous field) lead to reduced precision in determining formula_3.

"The issue of full disclosure was first raised in the context of locksmithing, in a 19th-century controversy regarding whether weaknesses in lock systems should be kept secret in the locksmithing community, or revealed to the public. Today, there are three major disclosure policies under which most others can be categorized: Non Disclosure, Coordinated Disclosure, and Full Disclosure. The major stakeholders in vulnerability research have their disclosure policies shaped by various motivations, it is not uncommon to observe campaigning, marketing or lobbying for their preferred policy to be adopted and chastising those who dissent. Many prominent security researchers favor full disclosure, whereas most vendors prefer coordinated disclosure.

"The line width formula_25 of the fringes in this case is what determines the precision with which formula_3 can be determined and is By increasing the time of flight in the non-interaction zone, formula_40, or equivalently increasing the length formula_14 of the non-interaction zone, the line width can be improved by as much as 0.6 times those of other methods.

"This is a statement of the time-energy uncertainty principle: the larger the uncertainty in the time domain, the smaller the uncertainty in the Energy domain, or equivalently the frequency domain. Thought of another way, if two waves of almost exactly the same frequency are superimposed upon each other, then it will be impossible to distinguish them if the resolution of our eyes is larger than the difference between the two waves. Only after a long period of time will the difference between two waves become large enough to differentiate the two.

"Advocates argue that low-skilled attackers can use this information to perform sophisticated attacks that would otherwise be beyond their ability, and the potential benefit does not outweigh the potential harm caused by malevolent actors. Only when the vendor has prepared guidance that even the most unsophisticated users can digest should the information be made public. This argument presupposes that vulnerability discovery is a mutually exclusive event, that only one person can discover a vulnerability. There are many examples of vulnerabilities being discovered simultaneously, often being exploited in secrecy before discovery by other researchers.

"While there may exist users who cannot benefit from vulnerability information, full disclosure advocates believe this demonstrates a contempt for the intelligence of end users. While it's true that some users cannot benefit from vulnerability information, if they're concerned with the security of their networks they are in a position to hire an expert to assist them as you would hire a mechanic to help with a car. Non disclosure is typically used when a researcher intends to use knowledge of a vulnerability to attack computer systems operated by their enemies, or to trade knowledge of a vulnerability to a third party for profit, who will typically use it to attack their enemies.

"Early Ramsey interferometers used two interaction zones separated in space, but it is also possible to use two pulses separated in time, as long as the pulses are coherent. In the case of time-separated pulses, the longer the time between pulses, the more precise the measurement. An atomic clock is fundamentally an oscillator whose frequency formula_2 is matched to that of an atomic transition of a two-level atom, formula_1. The oscillator is the parallel external electromagnetic field in the non-interaction zone of the Ramsey–Bordé interferometer.

"The atom-wave interferometer formed by either of these two paths leads to a phase difference that is dependent on both internal and external parameters, i.e. it is dependent on the physical distances by which the interaction zones are separated and on the internal state of the atom, as well as external applied fields. Another way to think about these interferometers in the traditional sense is that for each path there are two arms, each of which is denoted by the atomic state.

"Jewish feminism is a movement that seeks to make the religious, political, and social status of Jewish women equal to that of Jewish men. Feminist movements, with varying approaches and successes, have opened up within all major denominations of Judaism. There are different approaches and versions of feminist theology that exist within the Jewish community. Some of these theologies promote the idea that it is important to have a feminine characterization of God within the siddur (Jewish prayerbook) and service. They challenge the male rabbi teachings that only emphasize God as a man with masculine traits only.

"If an external field is applied to either rotate or accelerate the atoms, there will be a phase shift due to the induced de Broglie phase in each arm of the interferometer, and this will translate to a shift in the Ramsey fringes.

Self-affirming activities that significantly raises implicit self-esteem, such as viewing one's own Facebook profile page, has been shown to decrease motivation to do well in cognitive tasks of moderate difficulty.

"Persian has left a considerable influence on its neighboring languages, including other Iranian languages, the Turkic languages, Armenian, Georgian and the Indo-Aryan languages (especially Urdu). It also exerted some influence on Arabic, while borrowing vocabulary from it under medieval Arab rule.

" Fiduciary management is an approach to asset management that involves an asset owner appointing a third party to manage the total assets of the asset owner on an integrated basis through a combination of advisory and delegated investment services, with a view to achieving the asset owner's overall investment objectives. In principle, the model can be applied to the investments of any asset owner. In practice, the label is currently only used in relation to the management of institutional assets as opposed to retail assets and in relation to the management of assets of pension funds in particular and insurance companies to a lesser degree.

"However, the name ""Persian"" is still more widely used. The Academy of Persian Language and Literature has called for avoiding the use of the endonym ""Farsi"" in foreign languages and has maintained that ""Persian"" is the appropriate designation of the language in English, as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity.

There are efficient algorithms for testing polynomial irreducibility and factoring polynomials over finite field. They are a key step for factoring polynomials over the integers or the rational numbers.

"Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is an example of a deep result involving many mathematical tools, including finite fields. The Weil conjectures concern the number of points on algebraic varieties over finite fields and the theory has many applications including exponential and character sum estimates. Finite fields have widespread application in combinatorics, two well known examples being the definition of Paley Graphs and the related construction for Hadamard Matrices. In arithmetic combinatorics finite fields and finite field models are used extensively, such as in Szemerédi's theorem on arithmetic progressions. A finite field is not algebraically closed.
",3875
"To demonstrate this, consider the polynomial which has no roots in , since for all in . The direct limit of the system: with inclusion, is an infinite field. It is the algebraic closure of all the fields in the system, and is denoted by: formula_37. The inclusions commute with the Frobenius map, as it is defined the same way on each field (), so the Frobenius map defines an automorphism of formula_37, which carries all subfields back to themselves. In fact can be recovered as the fixed points of the th iterate of the Frobenius map.
",3876
"However unlike the case of finite fields, the Frobenius automorphism on formula_37 has infinite order, and it does not generate the full group of automorphisms of this field. That is, there are automorphisms of formula_37 which are not a power of the Frobenius map. However, the group generated by the Frobenius map is a dense subgroup of the automorphism group in the Krull topology. Algebraically, this corresponds to the additive group being dense in the profinite integers (direct product of the -adic integers over all primes , with the product topology).

"If we actually construct our finite fields in such a fashion that is contained in whenever divides , then this direct limit can be constructed as the union of all these fields. Even if we do not construct our fields this way, we can still speak of the algebraic closure, but some more delicacy is required in its construction.

" In theoretical physics, a Feynman diagram is a pictorial representation of the mathematical expressions describing the behavior and interaction of subatomic particles.

Within the canonical formulation of quantum field theory, a Feynman diagram represents a term in the Wick's expansion of the perturbative -matrix.

"Alternatively, the path integral formulation of quantum field theory represents the transition amplitude as a weighted sum of all possible histories of the system from the initial to the final state, in terms of either particles or fields. The transition amplitude is then given as the matrix element of the -matrix between the initial and the final states of the quantum system. When calculating scattering cross-sections in particle physics, the interaction between particles can be described by starting from a free field that describes the incoming and outgoing particles, and including an interaction Hamiltonian to describe how the particles deflect one another.

"The Dyson series can be alternatively rewritten as a sum over Feynman diagrams, where at each vertex both the energy and momentum are conserved, but where the length of the energy-momentum four-vector is not necessarily equal to the mass. The Feynman diagrams are much easier to keep track of than ""old-fashioned"" terms, because the old-fashioned way treats the particle and antiparticle contributions as separate. Each Feynman diagram is the sum of exponentially many old-fashioned terms, because each internal line can separately represent either a particle or an antiparticle.
",3926
"In a non-relativistic theory, there are no antiparticles and there is no doubling, so each Feynman diagram includes only one term. Feynman gave a prescription for calculating the amplitude (the Feynman rules, below) for any given diagram from a field theory Lagrangian. Each internal line corresponds to a factor of the virtual particle's propagator; each vertex where lines meet gives a factor derived from an interaction term in the Lagrangian, and incoming and outgoing lines carry an energy, momentum, and spin.

"In addition to their value as a mathematical tool, Feynman diagrams provide deep physical insight into the nature of particle interactions. Particles interact in every way available; in fact, intermediate virtual particles are allowed to propagate faster than light. The probability of each final state is then obtained by summing over all such possibilities. This is closely tied to the functional integral formulation of quantum mechanics, also invented by Feynman—see path integral formulation. The naïve application of such calculations often produces diagrams whose amplitudes are infinite, because the short-distance particle interactions require a careful limiting procedure, to include particle self-interactions.

"The technique of renormalization, suggested by Ernst Stueckelberg and Hans Bethe and implemented by Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga compensates for this effect and eliminates the troublesome infinities.

"Murray Gell-Mann always referred to Feynman diagrams as Stueckelberg diagrams, after a Swiss physicist, Ernst Stueckelberg, who devised a similar notation many years earlier. Stueckelberg was motivated by the need for a manifestly covariant formalism for quantum field theory, but did not provide as automated a way to handle symmetry factors and loops, although he was first to find the correct physical interpretation in terms of forward and backward in time particle paths, all without the path-integral.

"Historically, as a book-keeping device of covariant perturbation theory, the graphs were called Feynman–Dyson diagrams or Dyson graphs, because the path integral was unfamiliar when they were introduced, and Freeman Dyson's derivation from old-fashioned perturbation theory was easier to follow for physicists trained in earlier methods.

"In their presentations of fundamental interactions, written from the particle physics perspective, Gerard 't Hooft and Martinus Veltman gave good arguments for taking the original, non-regularized Feynman diagrams as the most succinct representation of our present knowledge about the physics of quantum scattering of fundamental particles. Their motivations are consistent with the convictions of James Daniel Bjorken and Sidney Drell: The Feynman graphs and rules of calculation summarize quantum field theory in a form in close contact with the experimental numbers one wants to understand.

"Although the statement of the theory in terms of graphs may imply perturbation theory, use of graphical methods in the many-body problem shows that this formalism is flexible enough to deal with phenomena of nonperturbative characters … Some modification of the Feynman rules of calculation may well outlive the elaborate mathematical structure of local canonical quantum field theory … So far there are no opposing opinions. In quantum field theories the Feynman diagrams are obtained from a Lagrangian by Feynman rules.

"Dimensional regularization is a method for regularizing integrals in the evaluation of Feynman diagrams; it assigns values to them that are meromorphic functions of an auxiliary complex parameter , called the dimension. Dimensional regularization writes a Feynman integral as an integral depending on the spacetime dimension and spacetime points. A Feynman diagram is a representation of quantum field theory processes in terms of particle interactions. The particles are represented by the lines of the diagram, which can be squiggly or straight, with an arrow or without, depending on the type of particle.

"A point where lines connect to other lines is a ""vertex"", and this is where the particles meet and interact: by emitting or absorbing new particles, deflecting one another, or changing type. There are three different types of lines: ""internal lines"" connect two vertices, ""incoming lines"" extend from ""the past"" to a vertex and represent an initial state, and ""outgoing lines"" extend from a vertex to ""the future"" and represent the final state (the latter two are also known as ""external lines"").

"When a group of incoming particles are to scatter off each other, the process can be thought of as one where the particles travel over all possible paths, including paths that go backward in time. Feynman diagrams are often confused with spacetime diagrams and bubble chamber images because they all describe particle scattering. Feynman diagrams are graphs that represent the interaction of particles rather than the physical position of the particle during a scattering process. Unlike a bubble chamber picture, only the sum of all the Feynman diagrams represent any given particle interaction; particles do not choose a particular diagram each time they interact.

"The law of summation is in accord with the principle of superposition—every diagram contributes to the total amplitude for the process. A Feynman diagram represents a perturbative contribution to the amplitude of a quantum transition from some initial quantum state to some final quantum state. For example, in the process of electron-positron annihilation the initial state is one electron and one positron, the final state: two photons. The initial state is often assumed to be at the left of the diagram and the final state at the right (although other conventions are also used quite often).

"Traditionally, the bottom of the diagram is the past and the top the future; other times, the past is to the left and the future to the right.

"In this case, the counting rule should apply the Euler algorithm by pairing up the Fermi lines at each vertex into pairs that together form a bosonic factor of the term in the Lagrangian, and when entering a vertex by one line, the algorithm should always leave with the partner line. To clarify and prove the rule, consider a Feynman diagram formed from vertices, terms in the Lagrangian, with Fermion fields. The full term is Bosonic, it is a commuting element of the Grassmann algebra, so the order in which the vertices appear is not important.

"The definition of ""particle"" in relativistic field theory is not self-evident, because if you try to determine the position so that the uncertainty is less than the compton wavelength, the uncertainty in energy is large enough to produce more particles and antiparticles of the same type from the vacuum. This means that the notion of a single-particle state is to some extent incompatible with the notion of an object localized in space. In the 1930s, Wigner gave a mathematical definition for single-particle states: they are a collection of states that form an irreducible representation of the Poincaré group.
",4010
"Single particle states describe an object with a finite mass, a well defined momentum, and a spin. This definition is fine for protons and neutrons, electrons and photons, but it excludes quarks, which are permanently confined, so the modern point of view is more accommodating: a particle is anything whose interaction can be described in terms of Feynman diagrams, which have an interpretation as a sum over particle trajectories. A field operator can act to produce a one-particle state from the vacuum, which means that the field operator produces a superposition of Wigner particle states.
",4011
"In the free field theory, the field produces one particle states only. But when there are interactions, the field operator can also produce 3-particle, 5-particle (if there is no +/− symmetry also 2, 4, 6 particle) states too. To compute the scattering amplitude for single particle states only requires a careful limit, sending the fields to infinity and integrating over space to get rid of the higher-order corrections.
",4012
"The relation between scattering and correlation functions is the LSZ-theorem: The scattering amplitude for particles to go to particles in a scattering event is the given by the sum of the Feynman diagrams that go into the correlation function for field insertions, leaving out the propagators for the external legs. For example, for the interaction of the previous section, the order contribution to the (Lorentz) correlation function is: Stripping off the external propagators, that is, removing the factors of , gives the invariant scattering amplitude : which is a constant, independent of the incoming and outgoing momentum.

"Thinking of Feynman diagrams as a perturbation series, nonperturbative effects like tunneling do not show up, because any effect that goes to zero faster than any polynomial does not affect the Taylor series. Even bound states are absent, since at any finite order particles are only exchanged a finite number of times, and to make a bound state, the binding force must last forever. But this point of view is misleading, because the diagrams not only describe scattering, but they also are a representation of the short-distance field theory correlations.
",4018
"This is because the nonrelativistic unit operator on single particle states is: In relativity, the integral over the -states for a particle of mass m integrates over a hyperbola in space defined by the energy–momentum relation: If the integral weighs each point equally, the measure is not Lorentz-invariant.

"(The perturbation series of any interacting quantum field theory has zero radius of convergence, complicating the limit of the infinite series of diagrams needed (in the limit of vanishing coupling) to describe such field configurations.) This means that nonperturbative effects show up asymptotically in resummations of infinite classes of diagrams, and these diagrams can be locally simple. The graphs determine the local equations of motion, while the allowed large-scale configurations describe non-perturbative physics.
",4020
"But because Feynman propagators are nonlocal in time, translating a field process to a coherent particle language is not completely intuitive, and has only been explicitly worked out in certain special cases. In the case of nonrelativistic bound states, the Bethe–Salpeter equation describes the class of diagrams to include to describe a relativistic atom. For quantum chromodynamics, the Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov sum rules describe non-perturbatively excited long-wavelength field modes in particle language, but only in a phenomenological way.

"The number of Feynman diagrams at high orders of perturbation theory is very large, because there are as many diagrams as there are graphs with a given number of nodes. Nonperturbative effects leave a signature on the way in which the number of diagrams and resummations diverge at high order. It is only because non-perturbative effects appear in hidden form in diagrams that it was possible to analyze nonperturbative effects in string theory, where in many cases a Feynman description is the only one available.

"The Euclidean space itself carries a natural structure of Riemannian manifold (the tangent spaces are naturally identified with the Euclidean space itself and carry the standard scalar product of the space). Many familiar curves and surfaces, including for example all -spheres, are specified as subspaces of a Euclidean space and inherit a metric from their embedding in it. A Finsler manifold allows the definition of distance but does not require the concept of angle; it is an analytic manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with a norm, ||·||, in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point.

"They encode not only asymptotic processes like particle scattering, they also describe the multiplication rules for fields, the operator product expansion. Nonperturbative tunneling processes involve field configurations that on average get big when the coupling constant gets small, but each configuration is a coherent superposition of particles whose local interactions are described by Feynman diagrams. When the coupling is small, these become collective processes that involve large numbers of particles, but where the interactions between each of the particles is simple.

"Hermann Hesse enjoyed Dostoevsky's work and cautioned that to read him is like a ""glimpse into the havoc"". The Norwegian novelist Knut Hamsun wrote that ""no one has analyzed the complicated human structure as Dostoyevsky. His psychologic sense is overwhelming and visionary."" The Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin's analysis of Dostoevsky came to be at the foundation of his theory of the novel. Bakhtin argued that Dostoevsky's use of multiple voices was a major advancement in the development of the novel as a genre.

"Basing his estimation on stated criteria of enduring art and individual genius, Nabokov judges Dostoevsky ""not a great writer, but rather a mediocre one—with flashes of excellent humour but, alas, with wastelands of literary platitudes in between"". Nabokov complains that the novels are peopled by ""neurotics and lunatics"" and states that Dostoevsky's characters do not develop: ""We get them all complete at the beginning of the tale and so they remain.""

"Dostoevsky's books have been translated into more than 170 languages. The German translator Wilhelm Wolfsohn published one of the first translations, parts of ""Poor Folk"", in an 1846–1847 magazine, and a French translation followed. French, German and Italian translations usually came directly from the original, while English translations were second-hand and of poor quality. The first English translations were by Marie von Thilo in 1881, but the first highly regarded ones were produced between 1912 and 1920 by Constance Garnett.

"Developed in 1978 by Burgoon, this theory has its roots in Uncertainty Reduction Theory, which attempts to predict and explain how communication is used to reduce uncertainty among people involved in conversations with one another the last time they meet.

"Burgoon suggests that nonverbal behavior is carefully tailored to conform to the communication rules of one's partner, while violating certain social norms and individual expectations may be ""a superior strategy to conformity"". Developed in 1996 by Buller & Burgoon, this theory describes how ""communication senders attempt to manipulate messages so as to be untruthful, which may cause them apprehension concerning their false communication being detected. Simultaneously, communication receivers try to unveil or detect the validity of that information, causing suspicion about whether or not the sender is being deceitful.""

"A 2011 article in the New Scientist magazine cited positive physical results from meditation, positive thinking and spiritual faith Skeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural. The first is ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"", meaning that a genuine improvement or spontaneous remission may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the faith healer or patient did or said. These patients would have improved just as well even had they done nothing.
",4098
"The second is the placebo effect, through which a person may experience genuine pain relief and other symptomatic alleviation. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed. In both cases the patient may experience a real reduction in symptoms, though in neither case has anything miraculous or inexplicable occurred. Both cases, however, are strictly limited to the body's natural abilities.

"Skeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a quack practice in which the ""healers"" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money.

"While this debate was unfolding, Congress used the 1997 Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act to pass incentives that gave pharmaceutical manufacturers a six-month patent term extension on new drugs submitted with pediatric trial data. The act reauthorizing these provisions, the 2002 Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, allowed the FDA to request NIH-sponsored testing for pediatric drug testing, although these requests are subject to NIH funding constraints. In the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, Congress codified the FDA's authority to mandate manufacturer-sponsored pediatric drug trials for certain drugs as a ""last resort"" if incentives and publicly funded mechanisms proved inadequate.

"The center of Califon is the historic iron bridge spanning the South Branch of the Raritan River, which divides the borough. Recently the State of New Jersey announced that the bridge would be replaced because a loaded school bus represented more weight than the aging bridge could safely carry. Incensed citizens objected, protective of the landmark, and found a colorful but simple solution; the school bus stops at one end of the bridge unloading the students, who then walk across to the other side. Then the empty bus, within imposed weight limits, drives across and the students get back on the bus to continue their ride. Thus the bridge was saved.

" In mathematics, particularly in algebra, a field extension is a pair of fields formula_1 such that the operations of ""E"" are those of ""F"" restricted to ""E"". In this case, ""F"" is an extension field of ""E"" and ""E"" is a subfield of ""F"". For example, under the usual notions of addition and multiplication, the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers; the real numbers are a subfield of the complex numbers.
",4137
"For example, the field of rational numbers is a subfield of the real numbers, which is itself a subfield of the complex numbers. More generally, the field of rational numbers is (or is isomorphic to) a subfield of any field of characteristic 0. The characteristic of a subfield is the same as the characteristic of the larger field. If ""K"" is a subfield of ""L"", then ""L"" is an extension field or simply extension of ""K"", and this pair of fields is a field extension.
",4138
"Such a field extension is denoted ""L"" / ""K"" (read as """"L"" over ""K""""). If ""L"" is an extension of ""F"", which is in turn an extension of ""K"", then ""F"" is said to be an intermediate field (or intermediate extension or subextension) of ""L"" / ""K"". Given a field extension , the larger field ""L"" is a ""K""-vector space. The dimension of this vector space is called the degree of the extension and is denoted by [""L"" : ""K""].

"If ""S"" consists of a single element ""s"", the extension is called a simple extension and ""s"" is called a primitive element of the extension. An extension field of the form is often said to result from the """" of ""S"" to ""K"". In characteristic 0, every finite extension is a simple extension.

In some literature the notation ""L"":""K"" is used.

For this purpose, one abstractly defines a field extension as an injective ring homomorphism between two fields.

" Flood fill, also called seed fill, is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array. It is used in the ""bucket"" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. The flood-fill algorithm takes three parameters: a start node, a target color, and a replacement color. The algorithm looks for all nodes in the array that are connected to the start node by a path of the target color and changes them to the replacement color.
",4166
"There are many ways in which the flood-fill algorithm can be structured, but they all make use of a queue or stack data structure, explicitly or implicitly. Depending on whether we consider nodes touching at the corners connected or not, we have two variations: eight-way and four-way respectively. One implicitly stack-based (recursive) flood-fill implementation (for a two-dimensional array) goes as follows: Though easy to understand, the implementation of the algorithm used above is impractical in languages and environments where stack space is severely constrained (e.g. Java applets).
",4167
"An explicitly queue-based implementation (sometimes called ""Forest Fire algorithm"") is shown in pseudo-code below. It is similar to the simple recursive solution, except that instead of making recursive calls, it pushes the nodes onto a queue for consumption: Practical implementations intended for filling rectangular areas can use a loop for the west and east directions as an optimization to avoid the overhead of stack or queue management: Adapting the algorithm to use an additional array to store the shape of the region allows generalization to cover ""fuzzy"" flood filling, where an element can differ by up to a specified threshold from the source symbol.
",4168
"Using this additional array as an alpha channel allows the edges of the filled region to blend somewhat smoothly with the not-filled region. A method exists that uses essentially no memory for four-connected regions by pretending to be a painter trying to paint the region without painting themselves into a corner. This is also a method for solving mazes. The four pixels making the primary boundary are examined to see what action should be taken. The painter could find themselves in one of several conditions: Where a path or boundary is to be followed, the right-hand rule is used.

"A closer non-commutative analog are central simple algebras (CSAs) – ring extensions over a field, which are simple algebra (no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as for a field) and where the center of the ring is exactly the field.

"We need a ""mark"" to define where we are and which direction we are heading to see if we ever get back to exactly the same pixel. If we already created such a ""mark"", then we preserve our previous mark and move to the next pixel following the right-hand rule. A mark is used for the first 2-pixel boundary that is encountered to remember where the passage started and in what direction the painter was moving. If the mark is encountered again and the painter is traveling in the same direction, then the painter knows that it is safe to paint the square with the mark and to continue in the same direction.
",4171
"This is because (through some unknown path) the pixels on the other side of the mark can be reached and painted in the future. The mark is removed for future use. If the painter encounters the mark but is going in a different direction, then some sort of loop has occurred, which caused the painter to return to the mark. This loop must be eliminated. The mark is picked up, and the painter then proceeds in the direction indicated previously by the mark using a left-hand rule for the boundary (similar to the right-hand rule but using the painter's left hand).
",4172
"This continues until an intersection is found (with three or more open boundary pixels). Still using the left-hand rule the painter now searches for a simple passage (made by two boundary pixels). Upon finding this two-pixel boundary path, that pixel is painted. This breaks the loop and allows the algorithm to continue. For case #4, we need to check the opposite 8-connected corners to see whether they are filled or not. If either or both are filled, then this creates a many-path intersection and cannot be filled.
",4173
"If both are empty, then the current pixel can be painted and the painter can move following the right-hand rule. The algorithm trades time for memory. For simple shapes it is very efficient. However, if the shape is complex with many features, the algorithm spends a large amount of time tracing the edges of the region trying to ensure that all can be painted. This algorithm was first available commercially in 1981 on a Vicom Image Processing system manufactured by Vicom Systems, Inc. The classic recursive flood fill algorithm was available on this system as well.

"This is a pseudocode implementation of an optimal fixed-memory flood-fill algorithm written in structured English: The variables: cur, mark, and mark2 each hold either pixel coordinates or a null value cur-dir, mark-dir, and mark2-dir each hold a direction (left, right, up, or down) backtrack and findloop each hold boolean values count is an integer The algorithm: The algorithm can be sped up by filling lines.

"Instead of pushing each potential future pixel coordinate on the stack, it inspects the neighbour lines (previous and next) to find adjacent segments that may be filled in a future pass; the coordinates (either the start or the end) of the line segment are pushed on the stack.

"Chapter 8 Travel by Dog Train These wild northlands are so destitute of roads that these tribes have no distinct words to represent land vehicles. In translating such words as wagon or chariot into the Cree language, we had to use a word similar to that for dog sled. No surveyor had yet visited these regions, and there were literally no roads as understood in civilized lands. The lakes and rivers are so numerous that roads are not necessary to the Indian in the summer time. With his light birch canoe, he can go almost everywhere he desires.

"Aerodynamic studies in the 1960s demonstrated that the ""vortex lift"" phenomenon could be harnessed by highly swept wing configurations to reach higher angles of attack, using leading edge vortex flow off a slender lifting surface. As the F-16 was being optimized for high combat agility, GD's designers chose a slender cropped-delta wing with a leading edge sweep of 40° and a straight trailing edge.

"The aircraft can carry various other AAMs, a wide variety of air-to-ground missiles, rockets or bombs; electronic countermeasures (ECM), navigation, targeting or weapons pods; and fuel tanks on 9 hardpoints – six under the wings, two on wingtips, and one under the fuselage. Two other locations under the fuselage are available for sensor or radar pods. The F-16 carries a 20 mm (0.787 in) M61A1 Vulcan cannon for close range aerial combat and strafing. The 20mm cannon is mounted inside the fuselage to the left of the cockpit.
",4201
"To counter the tendency to depart from controlled flight—and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (four-channel) fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces in such a way as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss.
",4202
"The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: ""You don't fly an F-16; it flies you."" The FLCC further incorporates limiters governing movement in the three main axes based on attitude, airspeed and angle of attack (AOA); these prevent control surfaces from inducing instability such as slips or skids, or a high AOA inducing a stall. The limiters also prevent maneuvers that would exert more than a 9 ""g"" load.

"The Belarusian region of Minsk Oblast has announced its intention to develop co-operation with the Malaysian state of Sabah, with the Belarusian side said that the relations in all spheres between the two countries should develop more actively, including between regions. Malaysia also seeking a military co-operation with Belarus to repair its military aircraft.
",4205
"The quadruplex design permits ""graceful degradation"" in flight control response in that the loss of one channel renders the FLCS a ""triplex"" system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40. The F-16's controls suffered from a sensitivity to static electricity or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Up to 70–80% of the C/D models' electronics were vulnerable to ESD.

"A key feature of the F-16's cockpit is the exceptional field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle over the side of the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision.

There, Hayek argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle.

"This argument, first proposed by Max Weber, says that the efficient exchange and use of resources can be maintained only through the price mechanism in free markets (see economic calculation problem). In 1935, Hayek published ""Collectivist Economic Planning"", a collection of essays from an earlier debate that had been initiated by Mises. Hayek included Mises's essay in which Mises argued that rational planning was impossible under socialism. Some socialists such as H. D. Dickinson and Oskar Lange responded by invoking general equilibrium theory, which they argued disproved Mises's thesis.
",4250
"However, in the real world different individuals have different bits of knowledge and furthermore some of what they believe is wrong. In ""The Use of Knowledge in Society"" (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve diverse and complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous self-organization. He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place.

"In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the rule of law, with as little arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book ""The Road to Serfdom"" (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism.
",4252
"In ""The Road to Serfdom"", Hayek wrote: Hayek posited that a central planning authority would have to be endowed with powers that would impact and ultimately control social life because the knowledge required for centrally planning an economy is inherently decentralised, and would need to be brought under control. Though Hayek did argue that the state should provide law centrally, others have pointed out that this contradicts his arguments about the role of judges in ""discovering"" the law, suggesting that Hayek would have supported decentralized provision of legal services.

"Usually, scientism involves combining the philosophers' ancient demand for demonstrative justification with the associationists' false view that all scientific explanations are simple two-variable linear relationships. Hayek points out that much of science involves the explanation of complex multivariable and nonlinear phenomena and the social science of economics and undesigned order compares favourably with such complex sciences as Darwinian biology.
",4255
"In ""Counter-Revolution"", for example, Hayek observed that the hard sciences attempt to remove the ""human factor"" to obtain objective and strictly controlled results: Meanwhile, the soft sciences are attempting to measure human action itself: He notes that these are mutually exclusive and that social sciences should not attempt to impose positivist methodology, nor to claim objective or definite results: In ""The Sensory Order: An Inquiry into the Foundations of Theoretical Psychology"" (1952), Hayek independently developed a ""Hebbian learning"" model of learning and memory—an idea he first conceived in 1920 prior to his study of economics.
",4256
"Hayek's expansion of the ""Hebbian synapse"" construction into a global brain theory has received attention in neuroscience, cognitive science, computer science, behavioural science and evolutionary psychology by scientists such as Gerald Edelman and Joaquin Fuster. ""The Sensory Order"" can be viewed as a development of his attack on scientism. Hayek posited two orders, namely the sensory order that we experience and the natural order that natural science has revealed. Hayek thought that the sensory order actually is a product of the brain.
",4257
"He described the brain as a very complex yet self-ordering hierarchical classification system, a huge network of connections. Because of these nature of the classifier system, richness of our sensory experience can exist. Hayek's description posed problems to behaviorism, whose proponents took the sensory order as fundamental. In the latter half of his career, Hayek made a number of contributions to social and political philosophy which he based on his views on the limits of human knowledge and the idea of spontaneous order in social institutions.

"For instance, Hayek put the price mechanism on the same level as language. Hayek attributed the birth of civilisation to private property in his book ""The Fatal Conceit"" (1988). He explained that price signals are the only means of enabling each economic decision maker to communicate tacit knowledge or dispersed knowledge to each other to solve the economic calculation problem.
",4261
"On this analysis, species takes the place of price as a visible element of the system formed by a complex set of largely unknowable elements. Human ignorance about the countless interactions between the organisms of an ecosystem limits our ability to manipulate nature. Since humans rely on the ecosystem to sustain themselves, we have a ""prima facie"" obligation to not disrupt such systems. This analysis of ecosystems as spontaneous orders does not rely on markets qualifying as spontaneous orders. As such, one need not endorse Hayek's analysis of markets to endorse ecosystems as spontaneous orders.

"To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves. So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of Law.

By endorsing the Bahraini dictatorship Prince Andrew is giving his implicit support to their oppressive practices. When our government sells arms it is giving moral and practical support to an illegitimate and authoritarian regime and directly supporting their systematic crackdown on opposition groups. (...) We shouldn't allow our international image to be used as a PR tool for the violent and oppressive dictatorship in Bahrain.""

"Hayek is widely recognised for having introduced the time dimension to the equilibrium construction and for his key role in helping inspire the fields of growth theory, information economics and the theory of spontaneous order. The ""informal"" economics presented in Milton Friedman's massively influential popular work ""Free to Choose"" (1980) is explicitly Hayekian in its account of the price system as a system for transmitting and co-ordinating knowledge. This can be explained by the fact that Friedman taught Hayek's famous paper ""The Use of Knowledge in Society"" (1945) in his graduate seminars.

The earlier era consisted of variants which are now described as the ""old type"" and ""old old type"", which were similar to each other, and were most common during the time period from the late 1950s to the mid 1980s. Both types viewed frontally appeared to have separate top and bottom parts, although both parts were fixed together.

I have gone to an Indian band far in the northern wilderness, and after they have become willing to receive the truth, I have commenced to teach them to read the Word of God. Our resources were very limited, for we were hundreds of miles from the nearest schoolhouse. But from the campfire where we had cooked our bear's meat or beaver, I would take a burnt stick and use it to make these syllabic characters on the side of a rock.

"The Obukhov length (formula_1), a characteristic length scale of surface layer turbulence derived by Obukhov in 1946, is used for non-dimensional scaling of the actual height. M–O similarity theory marked a significant landmark of modern micrometeorology, providing a theoretical basis for micrometerological experiments and measurement techniques. The Obukhov length formula_1 is a length parameter for the surface layer in the boundary layer, which characterizes the relative contributions to turbulent kinetic energy from buoyant production and shear production.

" A factoid is either a false statement presented as a fact, ""or"" a true but brief or trivial item of news or information. The term was coined in 1973 by American writer Norman Mailer to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true, or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print. Since its creation in 1973, the term has evolved, now often being used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information.

" Figured bass, also called thoroughbass, is a kind of musical notation in which numerals and symbols (often accidentals) indicate intervals, chords, and non-chord tones that a musician playing piano, harpsichord, organ, lute (or other instruments capable of playing chords) play in relation to the bass note that these numbers and symbols appear above or below. Figured bass is closely associated with basso continuo, a historically improvised accompaniment used in almost all genres of music in the Baroque period of Classical music (1600–1750), though rarely in modern music.
",4274
"Other systems for denoting or representing chords include plain staff notation, used in classical music; Roman numerals, commonly used in harmonic analysis; chord letters, sometimes used in modern musicology; the Nashville Number System; and various chord names and symbols used in jazz and popular music (e.g., C Major or simply C; D minor, Dm, or D-; G, etc.). Basso continuo parts, almost universal in the Baroque era (1600–1750), provided the harmonic structure of the music by supplying a bassline and a chord progression.

Several times we had to wade through muskegs up to our knees for miles, carrying our load on our heads or backs. At last we reached Beaver Lake. Here we camped for the night and talked over our future movements. We had come two hundred and forty miles through these northern wilds and still had about sixty miles to go before we expected to see human beings, but we were all absolutely ignorant of the direction to go.

"Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: masses by Anton Bruckner, Beethoven, and Franz Schubert, for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist. A part notated with figured bass consists of a bass line notated with notes on a musical staff plus added numbers and accidentals (or in some cases (back)slashes added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what intervals above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which inversions of which chords are to be played.

For example: has the same meaning as and can be realized as although the performer may choose which octave to play the notes in and will often elaborate them in some way, such as by playing them as arpeggios rather than as block chords, or by adding improvised ornaments, depending on the tempo and texture of the music. Sometimes, other numbers are omitted: a 2 on its own or indicates , for example.

"From the figured bass-writer's perspective, this bass note is obviously a third inversion seventh chord, so the sixth interval is viewed as an interval that the player should automatically infer. In many cases entire figures can be left out, usually where the chord is obvious from the progression or the melody. Sometimes the chord changes but the bass note itself is held. In these cases the figures for the new chord are written wherever in the bar they are meant to occur.

"We cleared away the snow from a space about eight feet square. At one side of this, we built up our fire. Over the rest of the cleared space, we spread some evergreen boughs on which we placed our beds. We unharnessed our dogs and thawed some frozen fish for them. As this was one of my short trips, I only had two dog trains and two Indians with me. We melted snow in our kettles, made tea, and cooked some meat. This, with the bread, constituted our meals.

"As part of the new galant style in the mid-18th century, with its emphasis on lighter and more varied textures, and singable melodies, orchestral music gradually phased out the basso continuo, and solo-with-accompaniment textures increasingly featured fully written-out accompaniments. By the second half of the 18th century, figured bass was almost entirely eliminated, except in sacred choral music, where it lingered until well after 1800.

In the woods at our camps, we build the fire where the smoke will be driven from us. If the wind changes, we change our fires. Here at the base of this cliff, we could do nothing of the kind. The result was that we were either shivering in the bitter cold or blinded by the smoke.

"In the 2000s, outside of professional Baroque ensembles that specialize in the performance practice of the Baroque era, the most common use of figured bass notation is to indicate the inversion in a harmonic analysis or composer's sketch context, however, often without the staff notation, using letter note names followed with the figure.
",4285
"In the 20th and 21st century, figured bass is also sometimes used by classical musicians as a shorthand way of indicating chords when a composer is sketching out ideas for a new piece or when a music student is analyzing the harmony of a notated piece of music (e.g., a Bach chorale or a Chopin piano prelude). Figured bass is not generally used in modern musical compositions, except for neo-Baroque pieces. A form of figured bass is used in notation of accordion music; another simplified form is used to notate guitar chords.

"According to sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, fashion connotes ""the latest fashion, the latest difference."" Even though they are often used together, the term fashion differs from clothes and costumes, where the first describes the material and technical garment, whereas the second has been relegated to special senses like fancy-dress or masquerade wear. Fashion instead describes the social and temporal system that ""activates"" dress as a social signifier in a certain time and context.

"Expo Line stations have since been redesigned and retrofitted to accommodate the new fare gate system. The 2008 Provincial Transit Plan outlined several SkyTrain system upgrades, including replacement of the proof-of-payment system with a gated-ticket system. According to Minister of Transportation Kevin Falcon, the gated-ticket system was to be implemented by a private company by 2010. In April 2009, it was announced that the provincial and federal governments would spend $100million to put the gates in place by the end of 2010.
",4291
"However, in August 2009, a TransLink spokesman said the gates would not be installed before 2012, and that a smart card system would be implemented at the same time. It was announced on August 14, 2013, that bus-issued transfers (magnetic strip paper cards) would continue to be issued for cash fares paid on buses, but that these transfers would not work at SkyTrain or SeaBus station fare gates, which require a Compass Card or a 90-minute paper Compass ticket to operate. This means that a bus rider paying cash is required to pay a second fare to transfer to SkyTrain or SeaBus.
",4292
"Those transit users paying cash but beginning their trips at a SkyTrain or SeaBus station are not subject to this second fare because they are issued Compass tickets which are accepted as valid transfers on TransLink buses. Construction of SkyTrain fare gates was completed in May 2014, but they remained open until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems.

"Fashion trends influenced by several factors, including cinema, celebrities, climate, creative explorations, innovations, designs, political, economic, social, and technological. Examining these factors is called a PEST analysis. Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine the growth or decline of a particular trend. It helps to know more about the Fashion arena and lifestyle in the modern world. Politics has played a central role in the development of fashion. For example, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was a fashionable icon of the early 1960s who led the formal dressing trend.

"Given that fashion designers began to experiment with the shapes of garment, loose sleeveless, micro-minis, flared skirts, and trumpet sleeves. In this case, the mini-skirt trend became an icon of the 1960s. Moreover, the political movement built an impressive relationship with fashion trends. For instance, during the Vietnam war, the youth of America made a movement that affected the whole country. In the 1960s, the fashion trend was full of fluorescent colors, prints patterns, bell-bottom jeans, fringed vests, and skirt became a protest outfit of the 1960s.

"This trend was called Hippie, and it is still affecting the current fashion trend. Technology plays a significant role in most aspects of today's society. Technological influences are growing more apparent in the fashion industry. Advances and new developments are shaping and creating current and future trends. Developments such as wearable technology have become an essential trend in fashion. They will continue with advances such as clothing constructed with solar panels that charge devices and smart fabrics that enhance wearer comfort by changing color or texture based on environmental changes. The fashion industry is seeing how 3D printing technology has influenced designers such as Iris Van Herpen and Kimberly Ovitz.

"These designers have been heavily experimenting and developing 3D printed couture pieces. As the technology grows, the 3D printers will become more accessible to designers and eventually, consumers, which could potentially shape the fashion industry entirely. Internet technology such as online retailers and social media platforms have given way for trends to be identified, marketed, and sold immediately.

Secondary methods are taking other information that has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for research.

"However, there are drawbacks to this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the greater public would react the same way as the focus group. Observation can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks, not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear.

SkyTrain's signalling system later provided the basis of SelTrac, which is currently maintained and sold by Thales and has equipped many lines around the world. Largely as a result of this, the Expo and Millennium Lines have a combined punctuality record of over 96 percent; the principal cause of train delays is passenger interference with train doors.

" In mathematics, Fourier analysis () is the study of the way general functions may be represented or approximated by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. Fourier analysis grew from the study of Fourier series, and is named after Joseph Fourier, who showed that representing a function as a sum of trigonometric functions greatly simplifies the study of heat transfer. Today, the subject of Fourier analysis encompasses a vast spectrum of mathematics. In the sciences and engineering, the process of decomposing a function into oscillatory components is often called Fourier analysis, while the operation of rebuilding the function from these pieces is known as Fourier synthesis.

"For example, determining what component frequencies are present in a musical note would involve computing the Fourier transform of a sampled musical note. One could then re-synthesize the same sound by including the frequency components as revealed in the Fourier analysis. In mathematics, the term ""Fourier analysis"" often refers to the study of both operations. The decomposition process itself is called a Fourier transformation. Its output, the Fourier transform, is often given a more specific name, which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed.

This wide applicability stems from many useful properties of the transforms: In forensics, laboratory infrared spectrophotometers use Fourier transform analysis for measuring the wavelengths of light at which a material will absorb in the infrared spectrum.

"The FT method is used to decode the measured signals and record the wavelength data. And by using a computer, these Fourier calculations are rapidly carried out, so that in a matter of seconds, a computer-operated FT-IR instrument can produce an infrared absorption pattern comparable to that of a prism instrument. Fourier transformation is also useful as a compact representation of a signal. For example, JPEG compression uses a variant of the Fourier transformation (discrete cosine transform) of small square pieces of a digital image.

"The Fourier components of each square are rounded to lower arithmetic precision, and weak components are eliminated entirely, so that the remaining components can be stored very compactly. In image reconstruction, each image square is reassembled from the preserved approximate Fourier-transformed components, which are then inverse-transformed to produce an approximation of the original image. When processing signals, such as audio, radio waves, light waves, seismic waves, and even images, Fourier analysis can isolate narrowband components of a compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection or removal.

"Two main hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the word ""español"": one based on dissimilation in Old Spanish ""españón"" (from a presumed Vulgar Latin *""hispaniōne""), and the other on an Occitan term derived from a presumed Vulgar Latin *""hispaniolus"". Both Latin ancestor words are based on the place name ""Hispania"" (which evolved into ""España"" by regular sound changes); and both are marked with an asterisk to indicate that they are reconstructed, not directly attested.
",4400
"Thus, some Latin American countries formerly under Spanish rule have retained the custom of calling it ""castellano"", while others eventually switched to calling it ""español"", with many different factors influencing the final choice. In English, the term ""Spanish"" relates both to the language and to the nation. The noun used for a person from Spain is ""Spaniard"", with the collective noun ""the Spanish"". The term ""Castilian"" is much less widespread amongst English speakers than the term ""Spanish"".
",4401
"This sporadic sound change is observed in some other words: Menéndez Pidal cites ""Barcelona"" (from ""Barcinone"") and ""delante"" (from ""de in ante""); Lathrop adds ""ingle"" (from ""ing[ui]ne"") and ""sangre"" (from ""sang[ui]ne""). According to the Occitan scenario, advanced by Rafael Lapesa, the Spanish borrowed the Occitan name for themselves, which was the name ""España"" plus the diminutive suffix ""-ol"", from the Latin ""-olus"".
",4402
"Similarly, ""español"" came to be used to refer to the common language of this new country: Castilian. The terms ""España"" and ""español"" spread to other languages. The English name ""Spain"" is from the French ""Espagne"". ""Spanish"" is ""Spain"" plus the English suffix ""-ish"".
",4403
"The term continues evolving as other languages adapt these words to form their own name for Spain—for example, Japanese スペイン語 (""Supein-go""), 'Spanish language', and スペイン人 (""Supein-jin""), 'Spaniard', derive from the Japanese word for Spain, スペイン (""Supein""), which, in turn, derives from English ""Spain"".
",4404
"In Chinese, the word is taken directly from Spanish (or perhaps even Latin) rather than English: 西班牙 ( ""xībānyá"") for Spain and 西班牙语 ( ""xībānyá yǔ""), or the abbreviation 西語 ( ""xī yǔ"") for the Spanish language. The Arabic إسبانية (""isbāniya"") for Spain derives directly from the word ""España"": the absence of ""p"" in the Arabic alphabet makes it a ""b"", and the sound ""ñ"" is transformed into ""n"".

"Then there was a little whispering among them, and one of them softly said in the Cree language, ""Non pimmatissit,"" the English of which is, ""He is not among the living."" These poor Indians, who had not as yet come to understand that death is a conquered foe, never like to use the word; so when speaking of those who have gone, they say they are ""not among the living."" When I learned in this expressive way that my old friend was dead, my heart was filled with sorrow, as I saw were theirs.

"""Castilla"" (""Castile"" in English) means 'Castle-land'. The word is derived from Latin ""castella"", the plural of ""castellum"", which, in turn, is a diminutive form of ""castrum"" 'fortress, castle'. Through most of the Middle Ages the word was spelled ""Castiella"", a form that survives in Leonese today. (Modern Spanish has transformed all words ending in ""-iello"", ""-iella"" into ""-illo"", ""-illa"".)
",4407
"While ""espanyol"" is used in Standard Philippine and other languages of the Philippines, the word ""kastilà"" is more frequently used. Furthermore ""katsila"" is also used among those who speak Visayan languages, such as Cebuano. During the presence of Moors in Hispania, Spanish was sometimes given the name ""cristiano"" (""Christian"") to distinguish it from the Arabic and Hebrew languages. This term is still used occasionally today to refer to the language, in a jocular tone.
",4408
"""The language of Cervantes"" in English—as a term for the Spanish language generally—comes into use in the 1840s. Examples appear in Janin (1841) and Campbell (1849). The poet Gonzalo de Berceo, writing in the 13th century, used the phrase ""román paladino"" to mean simple, straightforward language, the language spoken by the common people, as opposed to Latin.
",4409
"Both words are derived ultimately from Latin ""palatīnus"" ""of the palace"", with influence from Latin ""palam"" ""openly"".) Today ""román paladino"" is a high-sounding epithet for clear, straightforward Spanish. Recently it has been popularized in public speeches by Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has used it frequently as an equivalent for ""I will clearly state..."". In Spain, the Royal Spanish Academy is a normative body that rules on the orthography and general usage rules of the language.
",4410
"The Academy has used ""castellano"" since the 18th century, but since 1923, its dictionary and grammar are ""de la lengua española"" (""of the Spanish language""). The Academy's usage of one term is not necessarily a condemnation of the other. There are many other academies (grouped under the Association of Spanish Language Academies) that may or may not have an official normative recognition but nevertheless cooperate in the creation of the ""Diccionario panhispánico de dudas"" (a compendium of corrected typical mistakes and doubts).
",4411
"The dictionary, whose production was agreed upon by the 22 different Spanish Language Academies, says: Thus, even if both terms are allowed in Spanish, the use of ""español"" is recommended for the language as a whole. However, popular choice of terms is not so clear, with other factors, such as customs or geographical location, being factors. Spaniards tend to call the language ""español"" (Spanish) to contrast it to languages of other states, such as in a list with French (""francés""), German (""alemán""), etc.
",4412
"""Castellano"" (Castilian) by contrast, is more often used when contrasting the language with other regional languages of Spain: official languages like Basque, Catalan and Galician or unofficial ones like Aragonese, Asturian, Extremaduran and Leonese. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term ""el castellano"" to define the official language of the whole State, opposed to ""las demás lenguas españolas"" (""the other Spanish languages"").

"It offers K-7 education and is linked to the Waldorf-inspired Lunenburg County Independent High School, in Mahone Bay. A sustainability project was launched in Blockhouse in 2012: This was a non-profit, sustainability and community integration project. Working under the conditions of a lease granted by Lunenburg County Council, volunteers worked to show how an abandoned 16,000 sq foot municipal building could be transformed into a community hub: creating recreation space for families, working towards a community kitchen, presenting traditional methods in growing and preserving foods, incubating small, local businesses and dedicated to permaculture ideals and processes.
",4414
"In the regions where regional languages are spoken, there is obviously a daily need to make the contrast between the national language and the regional language and so the national language is most often referred to as Castilian, particularly in the regional languages themselves (for example, ""espanyol"" is virtually never used to refer to the language in Catalan: ""castellà"" is used instead; in Basque, the name of the language is ""gaztelania"" or ""gaztelera"", rather than ""espainiera""; and in Galician, the most commonly used term is ""castelán"" rather than ""español"").
",4415
"That is often mirrored by educated English-speakers to refer to the linguistic situation in Spain. For some, this use of the term ""castellano"" is a political or cultural statement that Spanish is only the language of Castile, perhaps also of some areas that Castile colonised, but not the language of their region, which they consider the only legitimate language to be the regional one: Catalan, Basque, Galician etc. That stance is common in regionalist circles.

"A complaint (lawsuit) must be filed in U.S. District Court (federal court) ""in camera"" (under seal). After an investigation by the Department of Justice within 60 days, or frequently several months after an extension is granted, the Department of Justice decides whether it will pursue the case. If the case is pursued, the amount of the reward is less than if the Department of Justice decides not to pursue the case and the plaintiff/relator continues the lawsuit himself. However, the success rate is higher in cases that the Department of Justice decides to pursue. Technically, the government has several options in handing cases.
",4417
"In Basque-speaking regions, whose language is not of Romance origin (Basque is considered by many scholars to be a language isolate), some Basque speakers also use the term ""erdara"" or ""erdera"" (""foreign"") specifically for Spanish, since for them, it is the prevalent foreign language, just as in the French Basque Country, ""French language"" is the usual meaning of ""erdara""; in fact, ""erdara"" is another language, different from Basque. In monolingual regions, the implications are a little different.
",4418
"In such regions, there is no identity implication, but still, they must choose one of the two terms. Castilians usually use the term ""el español"", legitimately presenting it as the national language . However, they also frequently call it ""el castellano"", either to assert their ownership or to distinguish it from the regional languages. Monolingual regions outside of Castile include mainly Andalusia but also other regions where the regional languages are not developed enough to be widely spoken by the majority of the population, such as Extremadura, Cantabria or Aragon.
",4419
"There, ""español"" may be used, as in Castile, to stress the national nature of the language but with a slightly different nuance: they are accepting another region's historical language as their own. The term ""castellano"" is occasionally used to imply more of a standard form than ""español"" does. For example, if someone mispronounces a word, they might be told ""¡Habla castellano! "", i.e. 'Speak Castilian! ', 'Speak properly!'.
",4420
"However, that nuance is not to be exaggerated, as it is perfectly possible that the term ""español"" or even, jocularly, ""cristiano"" ('Christian') could be used instead. Moreover, the term ""castellano"" is also commonly and correctly used to refer to dialects of Spanish, which deviate dramatically from the standard. Both names are commonly used in parts of the world colonized by Spanish speakers, such as Latin America and the Canary Islands. As in Spain, the implications are complex.

"The Court held that (1) the original source requirement of the FCA provision setting for the original-source exception to the public-disclosure bar on federal-court jurisdiction is jurisdictional; (2) the statutory phrase ""information on which the allegations are based"" refers to the relator's allegations and not the publicly disclosed allegations; the terms ""allegations"" is not limited to the allegations in the original complaint, but includes, at a minimum, the allegations in the original complaint as amended; (3) relator's knowledge with respect to the pondcrete fell short of the direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based required for him to qualify as an original source; and (4) the government's intervention did not provide an independent basis of jurisdiction with respect to the relator.

"Article 3 reads in part: This choice of words, however, varies depending on many factors, including the origin of the speaker or some political nuances.

"As most people who colonised were from Castilla, and the unification of Spain as a kingdom was very recent, colonisers normally referred to their language as ""lengua castellana"". In Chile, the introduction of ""español"" to refer to the Spanish language has mainly come from foreign influence, either through U.S. translations of T.V. shows or Latino and Central American cultural exchange. Peruvians often prefer the term ""castellano"" for similar reasons to avoid the linkage between ""español"" and ""España"".

In the context of anti-corruption, the paper acknowledges that there is a need to not only target serious and organised criminals but also support those who seek to help identify and disrupt serious and organised criminality.

"Using ""español"" to refer to Peninsular Spanish is exactly the opposite of how English-speakers use the two terms, which can create some confusion. ""Castellano"" may also be used to refer to the dialect of Spanish spoken in Castile, and ""español"" would generally refer to Standard Spanish. In practice, usage tends to be a matter of local custom rather than reflecting any philosophical or political position. However, the fact that Castile is now a region subsumed within modern Spain has been the decisive factor in the preferential usage of ""español"" in an international context.
",4426
"Some philologists use ""Castilian"" only for the language spoken in Castile during the Middle Ages and state that it is preferable to use ""Spanish"" for its modern form. The dialect of Spanish spoken in northern parts of modern Castile may also be called ""Castilian."" It differs from those of other regions of Spain (Andalusia for example); the Castilian dialect is conventionally considered in Spain to be the same as Standard Spanish. Another use of ""Castilian"" in English is to distinguish between Standard Spanish and regional dialects.

"The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby increasing its hardness.
",4428
"For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms. The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity (59.6×10 S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal.

"In their old ways, the women made little effort to keep their homes neat and tidy and their children or themselves clean. They had no encouragement to do anything of the kind. Kicked and cuffed and despised, they had no ambition to do anything more than what would save them from the rough treatment of those who considered themselves their lords and masters. Therefore, when they became Christians, they needed to learn a great deal before their simple little homes could be kept decently and in order. Fortunately, a great many of them had a desire to learn. A novel plan that we adopted was occasionally to go and dine with some of them.

"Copper does not react with water, but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides. There are 29 isotopes of copper.

"According to the British Geological Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third of the world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru. Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method. The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.

"Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since 1900, and more than half was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 10 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies.

"They are synthesized by treating copper(I) compounds with Grignard reagents, terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents; in particular, the last reaction described produces a Gilman reagent. These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products; as such, they are important in the field of organic synthesis. Copper(I) acetylide is highly shock-sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling.

"Conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds. Copper(I) forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide, especially in the presence of amine ligands. Copper(III) is most often found in oxides.

"Copper was first used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd century BC. In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did not start until the early 20th century. The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money.

"The shape of the pod was designed to be a low-drag body that will not generate lift regardless of angle of attack. The length of the shape was reduced to allow for aircraft maneuverability in crosswind. The internal structural members are designed to firmly hold the seat configuration in place, yet still provide a maximum field of vision for the pilot. Structural members attach to the main boom at a hard-point located behind the trailing edge of the wing. To successfully complete the challenge, it was determined that the propeller would need to produce 27.5 N of thrust when cruising at 11.5 m/s and spinning at 135 rpm.

"To meet these requirements, the propeller design underwent many alterations, with the final design broken into two components. Starting from a parent aircraft approach, primarily using the Musculair 1 and 2, but also including the Monarch B, MIT Daedalus, and Velair models, a first iteration choice for an airfoil was made. A modified version of the FX-76MP, as used for the Musculair 2 was chosen. Taking characteristics from this airfoil, using an initial weight buildup, the wing planform size was determined.

" Filtration is a physical, biological or chemical operation that separates solid matter and fluid from a mixture with a filter medium that has a complex structure through which only the fluid can pass. Solid particles that cannot pass through the filter medium are described as oversize and the fluid that passes through is called the filtrate. Oversize particles may form a filter cake on top of the filter and may also block the filter lattice, preventing the fluid phase from crossing the filter, known as blinding. The size of the largest particles that can successfully pass through a filter is called the effective pore size of that filter.
",4460
"The separation of solid and fluid is imperfect; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size, filter thickness and biological activity). Filtration occurs both in nature and in engineered systems; there are biological, geological, and industrial forms. There are many different methods of filtration; all aim to attain the separation of substances. Separation is achieved by some form of interaction between the substance or objects to be removed and the filter. The substance that is to pass through the filter must be a fluid, i.e. a liquid or gas.
",4461
"Methods of filtration vary depending on the location of the targeted material, i.e. whether it is dissolved in the fluid phase or suspended as a solid. There are several filtration techniques depending on the desired outcome namely, hot, cold and vacuum filtration. Some of the major purposes of getting the desired outcome are, for the removal of impurities from a mixture or, for the isolation of solids from a mixture. Hot filtration method is mainly used to separate solids from a hot solution.
",4462
"This is done in order to prevent crystal formation in the filter funnel and other apparatuses that comes in contact with the solution. As a result, the apparatus and the solution used are heated in order to prevent the rapid decrease in temperature which in turn, would lead to the crystallization of the solids in the funnel and hinder the filtration process. One of the most important measures to prevent the formation of crystals in the funnel and to undergo effective hot filtration is the use stemless filter funnel.

"Vacuum Filtration technique is most preferred for small batch of solution in order to quickly dry out small crystals. This method requires a Büchner funnel, filter paper of smaller diameter than the funnel, Büchner flask, and rubber tubing to connect to vacuum source.

"Büchner funnel, Belt filter, Rotary vacuum-drum filter, Cross-flow filters, Screen filter); and a depth filter, a bed of granular material which retains the solid particles as it passes (e.g. sand filter). The first type allows the solid particles, i.e. the residue, to be collected intact; the second type does not permit this. However, the second type is less prone to clogging due to the greater surface area where the particles can be trapped.

This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings. Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in ""normal"" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional.

"We often had to search miles from the shore to find what we wanted. To make our work more difficult, we found few large trees growing close together. So for nearly every large stick of timber, we had to make a new trail through the deep snow to the lake. The snow was three to four feet deep. The underbrush was thick, and the fallen trees were numerous. Yet even with these discouragements, we worked. We cut the trees down, measured them, squared them, and got them ready for their places.

"Activated carbon is often used in industrial applications that require changes in the filtrates properties, such as altering color or odor. These filter aids can be used in two different ways. They can be used as a precoat before the slurry is filtered. This will prevent gelatinous-type solids from plugging the filter medium and also give a clearer filtrate. They can also be added to the slurry before filtration. This increases the porosity of the cake and reduces resistance of the cake during filtration.
",4470
"In a rotary filter, the filter aid may be applied as a precoat; subsequently, thin slices of this layer are sliced off with the cake. The use of filter aids is usually limited to cases where the cake is discarded or where the precipitate can be chemically separated from the filter. Filtration is a more efficient method for the separation of mixtures than decantation, but is much more time-consuming. If very small amounts of solution are involved, most of the solution may be soaked up by the filter medium.
",4471
"Alternatively, the liquid may flow through the filter by the force exerted by a pump, a method commonly used in industry when a reduced filtration time is important. In this case, the filter need not be mounted vertically. Certain filter aids may be used to aid filtration. These are often incompressible diatomaceous earth, or kieselguhr, which is composed primarily of silica. Also used are wood cellulose and other inert porous solids such as the cheaper and safer perlite.
",4472
"An alternative to filtration is centrifugation—instead of filtering the mixture of solid and liquid particles, the mixture is centrifuged to force the (usually) denser solid to the bottom, where it often forms a firm cake. The liquid above can then be decanted. This method is especially useful for separating solids which do not filter well, such as gelatinous or fine particles. These solids can clog or pass through the filter, respectively.

" Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics. In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively.
",4475
"Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure. If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.
",4476
"In terms of mathematical optimization, dynamic programming usually refers to simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time. This is done by defining a sequence of value functions ""V"", ""V"", ..., ""V"" taking ""y"" as an argument representing the state of the system at times ""i"" from 1 to ""n"". The definition of ""V""(""y"") is the value obtained in state ""y"" at the last time ""n"".
",4477
"The values ""V"" at earlier times ""i"" = ""n"" −1, ""n"" − 2, ..., 2, 1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation. For ""i"" = 2, ..., ""n"", ""V"" at any state ""y"" is calculated from ""V"" by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time ""i"" − 1 and the function ""V"" at the new state of the system if this decision is made.
",4478
"Since ""V"" has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields ""V"" for those states. Finally, ""V"" at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.

"In control theory, a typical problem is to find an admissible control formula_1 which causes the system formula_2 to follow an admissible trajectory formula_3 on a continuous time interval formula_4 that minimizes a cost function The solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy formula_6, which produces an optimal trajectory formula_3 and a cost-to-go function formula_8. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming: a partial differential equation known as the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, in which formula_10 and formula_11.
",4480
"One finds the minimizing formula_12 in terms of formula_13, formula_14, and the unknown function formula_15 and then substitutes the result into the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation to get the partial differential equation to be solved with boundary condition formula_16. In practice, this generally requires numerical techniques for some discrete approximation to the exact optimization relationship.
",4481
"Alternatively, the continuous process can be approximated by a discrete system, which leads to a following recurrence relation analog to the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation: at the formula_18-th stage of formula_19 equally spaced discrete time intervals, and where formula_20 and formula_21 denote discrete approximations to formula_22 and formula_23. This functional equation is known as the Bellman equation, which can be solved for an exact solution of the discrete approximation of the optimization equation. In economics, the objective is generally to maximize (rather than minimize) some dynamic social welfare function.

"In Ramsey's problem, this function relates amounts of consumption to levels of utility. Loosely speaking, the planner faces the trade-off between contemporaneous consumption and future consumption (via investment in capital stock that is used in production), known as intertemporal choice. Future consumption is discounted at a constant rate formula_24. A discrete approximation to the transition equation of capital is given by where formula_26 is consumption, formula_18 is capital, and formula_22 is a production function satisfying the Inada conditions. An initial capital stock formula_29 is assumed.
",4483
"Let formula_30 be consumption in period , and assume consumption yields utility formula_31 as long as the consumer lives. Assume the consumer is impatient, so that he discounts future utility by a factor each period, where formula_32 be capital in period . Assume initial capital is a given amount formula_33, and suppose that this period's capital and consumption determine next period's capital as formula_34, where is a positive constant and formula_35 subject to formula_36 for all formula_37 Written this way, the problem looks complicated, because it involves solving for all the choice variables formula_38.
",4484
"(The capital formula_39 is not a choice variable—the consumer's initial capital is taken as given.) The dynamic programming approach to solve this problem involves breaking it apart into a sequence of smaller decisions. To do so, we define a sequence of ""value functions"" formula_40, for formula_41 which represent the value of having any amount of capital at each time . There is (by assumption) no utility from having capital after death, formula_42. The value of any quantity of capital at any previous time can be calculated by backward induction using the Bellman equation.
",4485
"In this problem, for each formula_37, the Bellman equation is This problem is much simpler than the one we wrote down before, because it involves only two decision variables, formula_30 and formula_47. Intuitively, instead of choosing his whole lifetime plan at birth, the consumer can take things one step at a time. At time , his current capital formula_48 is given, and he only needs to choose current consumption formula_30 and saving formula_47. To actually solve this problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, the current level of capital is denoted as .
",4486
"formula_51 is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate formula_52, and so on until we get to formula_53, which is the ""value"" of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime. In other words, once we know formula_54, we can calculate formula_55, which is the maximum of formula_56, where formula_57 is the choice variable and formula_58.
",4487
"Working backwards, it can be shown that the value function at time formula_59 is where each formula_61 is a constant, and the optimal amount to consume at time formula_59 is which can be simplified to We see that it is optimal to consume a larger fraction of current wealth as one gets older, finally consuming all remaining wealth in period , the last period of life. There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems.
",4488
"If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to ""non-overlapping"" sub-problems, the strategy is called ""divide and conquer"" instead. This is why merge sort and quick sort are not classified as dynamic programming problems. ""Optimal substructure"" means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of recursion.
",4489
"If ""p"" is truly the shortest path, then it can be split into sub-paths ""p"" from ""u"" to ""w"" and ""p"" from ""w"" to ""v"" such that these, in turn, are indeed the shortest paths between the corresponding vertices (by the simple cut-and-paste argument described in ""Introduction to Algorithms""). Hence, one can easily formulate the solution for finding shortest paths in a recursive manner, which is what the Bellman–Ford algorithm or the Floyd–Warshall algorithm does.
",4490
"""Overlapping"" sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. For example, consider the recursive formulation for generating the Fibonacci series: ""F"" = ""F"" + ""F"", with base case ""F"" = ""F"" = 1. Then ""F"" = ""F"" + ""F"", and ""F"" = ""F"" + ""F"".
",4491
"Now ""F"" is being solved in the recursive sub-trees of both ""F"" as well as ""F"". Even though the total number of sub-problems is actually small (only 43 of them), we end up solving the same problems over and over if we adopt a naive recursive solution such as this. Dynamic programming takes account of this fact and solves each sub-problem only once.
",4492
"This can be achieved in either of two ways: Some programming languages can automatically memoize the result of a function call with a particular set of arguments, in order to speed up call-by-name evaluation (this mechanism is referred to as ""call-by-need""). Some languages make it possible portably (e.g. Scheme, Common Lisp, Perl or D). Some languages have automatic memoization built in, such as tabled Prolog and J, which supports memoization with the ""M."" adverb.

"Using dynamic programming in the calculation of the ""n""th member of the Fibonacci sequence improves its performance greatly. Here is a naïve implementation, based directly on the mathematical definition: Notice that if we call, say, codice_1, we produce a call tree that calls the function on the same value many different times: In particular, codice_7 was calculated three times from scratch. In larger examples, many more values of codice_8, or ""subproblems"", are recalculated, leading to an exponential time algorithm.
",4496
"Now, suppose we have a simple map object, ""m"", which maps each value of codice_8 that has already been calculated to its result, and we modify our function to use it and update it. The resulting function requires only O(""n"") time instead of exponential time (but requires O(""n"") space): This technique of saving values that have already been calculated is called ""memoization""; this is the top-down approach, since we first break the problem into subproblems and then calculate and store values.
",4497
"In the bottom-up approach, we calculate the smaller values of codice_8 first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(""n"") time since it contains a loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, in contrast to the top-down approach which requires O(""n"") space to store the map. In both examples, we only calculate codice_7 one time, and then use it to calculate both codice_12 and codice_13, instead of computing it every time either of them is evaluated.

"The above method actually takes formula_65 time for large n because addition of two integers with formula_66 bits each takes formula_66 time. (The ""n"" fibonacci number has formula_66 bits.) Also, there is a closed form for the Fibonacci sequence, known as Binet's formula, from which the formula_19-th term can be computed in approximately formula_70 time, which is more efficient than the above dynamic programming technique. However, the simple recurrence directly gives the matrix form that leads to an approximately formula_71 algorithm by fast matrix exponentiation.

Backtracking for this problem consists of choosing some order of the matrix elements and recursively placing ones or zeros, while checking that in every row and column the number of elements that have not been assigned plus the number of ones or zeros are both at least . While more sophisticated than brute force, this approach will visit every solution once, making it impractical for larger than six, since the number of solutions is already 116,963,796,250 for  = 8, as we shall see.

"Other symptoms include sensory, sleep, and emotional problems. The main motor symptoms are collectively called ""parkinsonism"", or a ""parkinsonian syndrome"". While the cause of PD is unknown, it is believed to involve both inherited and environmental factors. Those with a family member affected are more likely to get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and coffee or tea drinkers.

"The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, leading to a dopamine deficit. The cause of this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging used to rule out other diseases. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people over the age of 60, of whom about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than females at a ratio of around 3:2.

" Functional linguistics is the approach to the study of language that sees functionality of language and its elements to be the key to understanding linguistic processes and structures. Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analyzed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. These include the tasks of conveying meaning and contextual information. Functional theories of grammar belong to structural and humanistic linguistics, considering language as a rational human construction. They take into account the context where linguistic elements are used and study the way they are instrumentally useful or functional in the given environment.
",4552
"This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used in communicative context. The formal relations between linguistic elements are assumed to be functionally-motivated. Simon Dik characterises the functional approach as follows: The establishment of functional linguistics follows from a shift from structural to functional explanation in 1920s sociology. Prague, at the crossroads of western European structuralism and Russian formalism, became an important centre for functional linguistics. The shift was related to the organic analogy exploited by Émile Durkheim and Ferdinand de Saussure.

Eddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery in 1873.

"These mutations are present in less than 1% of the unaffected population. The risk of developing PD is increased 20–30 fold if these mutations are present. PD associated with these mutations has the same clinical features, but an earlier age of onset and a more rapid cognitive and motor decline. This gene encodes glucocerebrosidase. Low levels of this enzyme cause Gaucher's disease. ""SNCA"" gene mutations are important in PD because the protein which this gene encodes, alpha-synuclein, is the main component of the Lewy bodies that accumulate in the brains of people with PD.

"This brought about a functionalism‒formalism debate, with Frederick Newmeyer arguing that the evolutionary psychological approach to linguistics should also be considered as functionalist. The terms functionalism and functional linguistics nonetheless continue to be used by the Prague linguistic circle and its derivatives, including SILF, Danish functional school, Systemic functional linguistics and Functional discourse grammar; and the American framework Role and reference grammar which sees itself as the midway between formal and functional linguistics. Functional analysis is the examination of how linguistic elements function on different layers of linguistic structure, and how the levels interact with each other.

"Functions exist on all levels of grammar, even in phonology, where the phoneme has the function of distinguishing between lexical material. In the functional mode of explanation, a linguistic structure is explained with an appeal to its function. Functional linguistics takes as its starting point the notion that communication is the primary purpose of language. Therefore, general phonological, morphosyntactic and semantic phenomena are thought of as being motivated by the needs of people to communicate successfully with each other. Thus, the perspective is taken that the organisation of language reflects its use value.

"Based on earlier linguists' work, Prague Circle linguists Vilém Mathesius, Jan Firbas and others elaborated the concept of theme–rheme relations (topic and comment) to study pragmatic concepts such as sentence focus, and givenness of information, to successfully explain word-order variation. The method has been used widely in linguistics to uncover word-order patterns in the languages of the world. Its importance, however, is limited to within-language variation, with no apparent explanation of cross-linguistic word order tendencies.

"According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings proposed by Heiko Braak, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction).

"Drugs that are used to treat PD, conversely, may produce excessive dopamine activity, allowing motor systems to be activated at inappropriate times and thereby producing dyskinesias. There is speculation of several mechanisms by which the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies.

"The concept of economy is metaphorically transferred from a social or economical context to a linguistic level. It is considered as a regulating force in language maintenance. Controlling the impact of language change or internal and external conflicts of the system, the economy principle means that systemic coherence is maintained without increasing energy cost. This is why all human languages, no matter how different they are, have high functional value as based on a compromise between the competing motivations of speaker-easiness (simplicity or ""inertia"") versus hearer-easiness (clarity or ""energeia"").
",4567
"When a decision is made to perform a particular action, inhibition is reduced for the required motor system, thereby releasing it for activation. Dopamine acts to facilitate this release of inhibition, so high levels of dopamine function tend to promote motor activity, while low levels of dopamine function, such as occur in PD, demand greater exertions of effort for any given movement. Thus, the net effect of dopamine depletion is to produce hypokinesia, an overall reduction in motor output.

"Fick's first law relates the diffusive flux to the gradient of the concentration. It postulates that the flux goes from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration, with a magnitude that is proportional to the concentration gradient (spatial derivative), or in simplistic terms the concept that a solute will move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration across a concentration gradient.

"Fick's work was inspired by the earlier experiments of Thomas Graham, which fell short of proposing the fundamental laws for which Fick would become famous. Fick's law is analogous to the relationships discovered at the same epoch by other eminent scientists: Darcy's law (hydraulic flow), Ohm's law (charge transport), and Fourier's Law (heat transport). Fick's experiments (modeled on Graham's) dealt with measuring the concentrations and fluxes of salt, diffusing between two reservoirs through tubes of water.

"The only source of flux in this situation is assumed to be diffusive flux: Plugging the definition of diffusive flux to the continuity equation and assuming there is no source (), we arrive at Fick's second law: If flux were the result of both diffusive flux and advective flux, the convection–diffusion equation is the result.

"In addition frequent subculturng, some antioxidants such as citric acid and ascorbic acid, PVP (polyvinyl pyrolidone) and activated carbon which are added into medium, can also reduce phenolic oxidation and contribute to regeneration from explants (Toth _et al.,_ 1994).

"This case is valid when some solution with concentration is put in contact with a layer of pure solvent. (Bokstein, 2005) The length is called the ""diffusion length"" and provides a measure of how far the concentration has propagated in the -direction by diffusion in time (Bird, 1976). As a quick approximation of the error function, the first 2 terms of the Taylor series can be used: If is time-dependent, the diffusion length becomes This idea is useful for estimating a diffusion length over a heating and cooling cycle, where varies with temperature.

"For a cylindrical cactus, the diffusion from photosynthetic cells on its surface to its center (the axis of its cylindrical symmetry) is a 2-D diffusion.

The MSD is symmetrically distributed over the 1D, 2D, and 3D space. Thus, the probability distribution of the magnitude of MSD in 1D is Gaussian and 3D is Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

"Compared to callus based regeneration by somatic embryogenesis the advantages to use the meristem based method are: a low incidence of culture induced genetic change and a simple and direct development of transformed plants (Gould _et al.,_ 1991).Generally it is necessary to transfer embryogenic cultures in a medium with reduced hormone concentration and nutrient content or with no hormone, to initiate /or mature somatic embryos. Other methods used for this purposes include exertion of stressful conditions, such as heat, cold and temporary starvation.

"Equations based on Fick's law have been commonly used to model transport processes in foods, neurons, biopolymers, pharmaceuticals, porous soils, population dynamics, nuclear materials, plasma physics, and semiconductor doping processes. Theory of all voltammetric methods is based on solutions of Fick's equation.

An initial study indicated that selegiline in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven. Other drugs such as amantadine and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments.

"These are the globus pallidus interna, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and the pedunculopontine nucleus. DBS of the globus pallidus interna improves motor function while DBS of the thalamic DBS improves tremor but has little effect on bradykinesia or rigidity. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is usually avoided if a history of depression or neurocognitive impairment is present. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus is associated with reduction in medication.

However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset. Since current therapies improve motor symptoms, disability at present is mainly related to non-motor features of the disease.
",4604
"Nevertheless, the relationship between disease progression and disability is not linear. Disability is initially related to motor symptoms. As the disease advances, disability is more related to motor symptoms that do not respond adequately to medication, such as swallowing/speech difficulties, and gait/balance problems; and also to levodopa-induced complications, which appear in up to 50% of individuals after 5 years of levodopa usage. Finally, after ten years most people with the disease have autonomic disturbances, sleep problems, mood alterations and cognitive decline. All of these symptoms, especially cognitive decline, greatly increase disability.

"The movement traced its roots in the United States to Phineas Parkhurst Quimby (1802–1866), a New England clockmaker turned mental healer, whose motto was ""the truth is the cure."" Mary Baker Eddy had been a patient of his, leading to debate about how much of Christian Science was based on his ideas. New Thought and Christian Science differed in that Eddy saw her views as a unique and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others) marked another distinction, introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature.

In 1895, in the ""Manual of the Mother Church"", she ordained the Bible and ""Science and Health"" as ""Pastor over the Mother Church"". Christian Science was defined by Eddy as “the law of God, the law of good, interpreting and demonstrating the divine Principle and rule of universal harmony,” which she named her church after.

"The annual cost in the UK is estimated to be between £49 million and £3.3 billion, while the cost per patient per year in the U.S. is probably around $10,000 and the total burden around $23 billion. The largest share of direct cost comes from inpatient care and nursing homes, while the share coming from medication is substantially lower. Indirect costs are high, due to reduced productivity and the burden on caregivers. In addition to economic costs, PD reduces quality of life of those with the disease and their caregivers.

"The appearance of parkinsonism in a group of drug addicts in the early 1980s who consumed a contaminated batch of the synthetic opiate MPPP led to the discovery of the chemical MPTP as an agent that causes parkinsonism in non-human primates as well as in humans. Other predominant toxin-based models employ the insecticide rotenone, the herbicide paraquat and the fungicide maneb. Models based on toxins are most commonly used in primates. Transgenic rodent models that replicate various aspects of PD have been developed.

" In linguistics, false friends are words in different languages that look or sound similar, but differ significantly in meaning. An example is the English ""embarrassed"" and the Spanish ""embarazada"" (which means ""pregnant""), the word ""parents"" and the Portuguese ""parentes"" and Italian ""parenti"" (which both mean ""relatives""), or the word ""sensible"", which means ""reasonable"" in English, but ""sensitive"" in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
",4631
"The term originates from a book by French linguists describing the phenomenon, which was translated in 1928 and entitled, ""false friend of a translator"". As well as producing completely false friends, the use of loanwords often results in the use of a word in a restricted context, which may then develop new meanings not found in the original language.
",4632
"If language A borrowed a word from language B, or both borrowed the word from a third language or inherited it from a common ancestor, and later the word shifted in meaning or acquired additional meanings in at least one of these languages, a native speaker of one language will face a false friend when learning the other. Sometimes, presumably both senses were present in the common ancestor language, but the cognate words got different restricted senses in Language A and Language B.
",4633
"""Actual"", which in English is usually a synonym of ""real"", has a different meaning in other European languages, in which it means 'current' or 'up-to-date', and has the logical derivative as a verb, meaning 'to make current' or 'to update'. ""Actualise"" (or 'actualize') in English means 'to make a reality of'. The word ""friend"" itself has cognates in the other Germanic languages; but the Scandinavian ones (like Swedish ""frände"", Danish ""frænde"") predominantly mean 'relative'.
",4634
"The original Proto-Germanic word meant simply 'someone whom one cares for' and could therefore refer to both a friend and a relative, but lost various degrees of the 'friend' sense in Scandinavian languages, while it mostly lost the sense of 'relative' in English. (The plural ""friends"" is still rarely used for ""kinsfolk"", as in the Scottish proverb ""Friends agree best at a distance"", quoted in 1721.)
",4635
"The Estonian and Finnish languages are closely related, which gives rise to false friends: Or Estonian ""vaimu"" ‘spirit; ghost’ and Finnish ""vaimo"" ‘wife’, ; or Estonian ""huvitav"" ‘interesting’ and Finnish ""huvittava"" ‘amusing’. A high level of lexical similarity exists between German and Dutch, but shifts in meaning of words with a shared etymology have in some instances resulted in 'bi-directional false friends': In Belgium, similarities between Dutch and French words often lead to confusion when several different meanings of the same word are mixed up and thus mistranslated.
",4636
"The Danish and Norwegian word ""semester"" means term (as in school term), but the Swedish word ""semester"" means holiday. The Danish word ""frokost"" means lunch, the Norwegian word ""frokost"" means breakfast. In French, the word ""Hure"" refers to the head of a boar, while in German """" means prostitute. Pseudo-anglicisms are new words formed from English morphemes independently from an analogous English construct and with a different intended meaning.
",4637
"Japanese is replete with pseudo-anglicisms, known as ""wasei-eigo"" (""Japan-made English""). In bilingual situations, false friends often result in a semantic change—a real new meaning that is then commonly used in a language. For example, the Portuguese ""humoroso"" ('capricious') changed its referent in American Portuguese to 'humorous', owing to the English surface-cognate ""humorous.""
",4638
"This phenomenon is analyzed by Ghil'ad Zuckermann as ""(incestuous) phono-semantic matching"".
",4639
" False cognates are pairs of words that seem to be cognates because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same language or from different languages, even within the same family. For example, the English word ""dog"" and the Mbabaram word ""dog"" have exactly the same meaning and very similar pronunciations, but by complete coincidence. Likewise, English ""much"" and Spanish ""mucho"" which came by their similar meanings via completely different Proto-Indo-European roots.
",4640
"This is different from false friends, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related. Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them (for example by phono-semantic matching or folk etymology). The term ""false cognate"" is sometimes misused to refer to false friends, but the two phenomena are distinct. False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings.
",4641
"For example, the Hebrew word ""dal"" (""poor"") (which is a false cognate of the phono-semantically similar English word ""dull"") is used in the new Israeli Hebrew expression אין רגע דל ""en rega dal"" (literally ""There is no poor moment"") as a phono-semantic matching for the English expression ""Never a dull moment"".
",4642
"Similarly, the Hebrew word דיבוב ""dibúv"" (""speech, inducing someone to speak""), which is a false cognate of (and thus etymologically unrelated to) the phono-semantically similar English word ""dubbing"", is then used in the Israeli phono-semantic matching for ""dubbing"". The result is that in today's Israel, דיבוב ""dibúv"" means ""dubbing"".

" Fundamental analysis, in accounting and finance, is the analysis of a business's financial statements (usually to analyze the business's assets, liabilities, and earnings); health; and competitors and markets. It also considers the overall state of the economy and factors including interest rates, production, earnings, employment, GDP, housing, manufacturing and management. There are two basic approaches that can be used: bottom up analysis and top down analysis. These terms are used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative and technical.
",4644
"Fundamental analysis is performed on historical and present data, but with the goal of making financial forecasts. There are several possible objectives: There are two basic methodologies investors rely upon when the objective of the analysis is to determine what stock to buy and at what price: Investors can use one or both of these complementary methods for stock picking. For example, many fundamental investors use technical indicators for deciding entry and exit points. Similarly, a large proportion of technical investors use fundamental indicators to limit their pool of possible stocks to ""good"" companies.
",4645
"The choice of stock analysis is determined by the investor's belief in the different paradigms for ""how the stock market works"". For explanations of these paradigms, see the discussions at efficient-market hypothesis, random walk hypothesis, capital asset pricing model, Fed model Theory of Equity Valuation, market-based valuation, and behavioral finance. Fundamental analysis includes: The intrinsic value of the shares is determined based upon these three analyses. It is this value that is considered the true value of the share. If the intrinsic value is higher than the market price, buying the share is recommended.
",4646
"If it is equal to market price, it is recommended to hold the share; and if it is less than the market price, then one should sell the shares. Investors may also use fundamental analysis within different portfolio management styles. Investors using fundamental analysis can use either a top-down or bottom-up approach. The analysis of a business's health starts with a financial statement analysis that includes financial ratios. It looks at dividends paid, operating cash flow, new equity issues and capital financing.
",4647
"The earnings estimates and growth rate projections published widely by Thomson Reuters and others can be considered either ""fundamental"" (they are facts) or ""technical"" (they are investor sentiment) based on perception of their validity. Determined growth rates (of income and cash) and risk levels (to determine the discount rate) are used in various valuation models. The foremost is the discounted cash flow model, which calculates the present value of the future: The amount of debt a company possesses is also a major consideration in determining its health.
",4648
"It can be quickly assessed using the debt-to-equity ratio and the ""current ratio"" (current assets/current liabilities). The simple model commonly used is the P/E ratio (price-to-earnings ratio). Implicit in this model of a perpetual annuity (time value of money) is that the inverse, or the E/P rate, is the discount rate appropriate to the risk of the business. This model does not incorporate earnings growth. Growth estimates are incorporated into the PEG ratio. Its validity depends on the length of time analysts believe the growth will continue.
",4649
"IGAR models can be used to impute expected changes in growth from current P/E and historical growth rates for the stocks relative to a comparison index. The process of fundamental analysis has significantly dropped in difficulty over the past 10 years. Ever since computers became a household product, people have built software designed to make the investor's life easier. Fundamental analysis is one of the most time-consuming forms of analysis. Furthermore, with the fast-paced trading style of the 21st century, where markets are dominated by HFT firms and day traders, it is difficult to keep up with the market in a timely fashion.
",4650
"One way to go about cutting down analysis time, is to subscribe to either free or paid screening services. Screening services will allow you to search the entire market for stocks that match the quantitative fields you are looking for. These types of software then automatically give you results, hence cutting down on time spent sifting through SEC filings.

Economists such as Burton Malkiel suggest that neither fundamental analysis nor technical analysis is useful in outperforming the markets. This is especially true of low liquidity markets or securities.

"Genetic engineering of cotton is prudent for at least the following three reasons. 1. Intensive management of cotton, since it is susceptible to attack by several insect pests, nematodes and fungal pathogens. Engineering cotton to express anti-pathogen compounds would make cotton production more cost effective. 2. Improvement of cotton by conventional plant breeding practices has limitations due to time consuming selection programs and lack of availability of wild relatives with desired agronomic and fiber traits.

"Most of the commercial varieties currently available have been produced by hand emasculation and crossing and recurrent selection in progeny rows, which requires approximately 6-7 years for production. Hybrid cotton can only be produced currently by hand emasculation and pollination due to lack of availability of methods for inducing male sterility and pollen restoration (Jenkins, 1993).

" In mathematics, functional decomposition is the process of resolving a functional relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed (i.e., recomposed) from those parts by function composition. This process of decomposition may be undertaken to gain insight into the identity of the constituent components which may reflect individual physical processes of interest. Also functional decomposition may result in a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of ""modularity"" (i.e., independence or non-interaction).
",4675
"** **Effect of Genotypes on callus induction** Out of the four genotypes studied, the genotype Coker 310 showed maximum response for all the _in vitro_ studies _viz._ , callus induction, proliferation, shoot and root induction and growth, somatic embryogenesis and plantlet development. Coker varieties appeared to be superior to other varieties in their embryogenic response (Davidonis and Hamilton, 1983; Shoemaker _et al_., 1986).
",4676
"In general, functional decompositions are worthwhile when there is a certain ""sparseness"" in the dependency structure; that is, when constituent functions are found to depend on approximately disjoint sets of variables. Thus, for example, if we can obtain a decomposition of formula_11 into a hierarchical composition of functions formula_12 such that formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, as shown in the figure at right, this would probably be considered a highly valuable decomposition.
",4677
"A basic example of functional decomposition is expressing the four binary arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in terms of the two binary operations of addition formula_16 and multiplication formula_17 and the two unary operations of additive inversion formula_18 and multiplicative inversion formula_19 Subtraction can then be realized as the composition of addition and additive inversion, formula_20 and division can be realized as the composition of multiplication and multiplicative inverse, formula_21 This simplifies the analysis of subtraction and division, and also makes it easier to axiomatize these operations in the notion of a field, as there are only two binary and two unary operations, rather than four binary operations.
",4678
"For a multivariate function formula_1, functional decomposition generally refers to a process of identifying a set of functions formula_2 such that where formula_4 is some other function. Thus, we would say that the function formula_5 is decomposed into functions formula_2. This process is intrinsically hierarchical in the sense that we can (and often do) seek to further decompose the functions formula_7 into a collection of constituent functions formula_8 such that where formula_10 is some other function. Decompositions of this kind are interesting and important for a wide variety of reasons.
",4679
"However, if the decomposition into formula_12 given above is possible, then formula_27 requires storing 4 values, formula_28 requires storing formula_29 values, and formula_30 again requires storing just 4 values. So in virtue of the decomposition, we need store only formula_31 values rather than 1024 values, a dramatic savings. Intuitively, this reduction in representation size is achieved simply because each variable depends only on a subset of the other variables. Thus, variable formula_32 only depends directly on variable formula_33, rather than depending on the ""entire set"" of variables.
",4680
"We would say that variable formula_33 ""screens off"" variable formula_32 from the rest of the world. Practical examples of this phenomenon surround us, as discussed in the ""Philosophical Considerations"" below, but let's just consider the particular case of ""northbound traffic on the West Side Highway."" Let us assume this variable (formula_36) takes on three possible values of {""moving slow"", ""moving deadly slow"", ""not moving at all""}.
",4681
"Extending these primitive operations, there is a rich literature on the topic of polynomial decomposition. As to ""why"" the decomposition is valuable, the reason is twofold. Firstly, decomposition of a function into non-interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function. For example, on a set of quaternary (i.e., 4-ary) variables, representing the full function formula_22 requires storing formula_23 values, the value of the function for each element in the Cartesian product formula_24, i.e., each of the 1024 possible combinations for formula_24.
",4682
"all these other secondary variables are not directly relevant to the West Side Highway traffic. All we need (hypothetically) in order to predict the West Side Highway traffic is the weather and the GW Bridge traffic, because these two variables ""screen off"" West Side Highway traffic from all other potential influences. That is, all other influences act ""through"" them. Outside of purely mathematical considerations, perhaps the greatest value of functional decomposition is the insight it provides into the structure of the world. When a functional decomposition can be achieved, this provides ontological information about what structures actually exist in the world, and how they can be predicted and manipulated.

"It is unknown whether Méliès authorized the coloring, as the stencil process is highly unusual in his oeuvre; normally, his films were colored using an entirely freehand method supervised by the colorist Elisabeth Thuillier.
",4684
"For example, in the illustration above, if it is learned that formula_36 depends directly only on formula_39, this means that for purposes of prediction of formula_36, it suffices to know only formula_39. Moreover, interventions to influence formula_36 can be taken directly on formula_39, and nothing additional can be gained by intervening on variables formula_44, since these only act through formula_39 in any case. The philosophical antecedents and ramifications of functional decomposition are quite broad, as functional decomposition in one guise or another underlies all of modern science.
",4685
"Here we review just a few of these philosophical considerations. One of the major distinctions that is often drawn between Eastern philosophy and Western Philosophy is that the Eastern philosophers tended to espouse ideas favoring holism while the Western thinkers tended to espouse ideas favoring reductionism. This distinction between East and West is akin to other philosophical distinctions (such as realism vs. anti-realism). Some examples of the Eastern holistic spirit: The Western tradition, from its origins among the Greek philosophers, preferred a position in which drawing correct distinctions, divisions, and contrasts was considered the very pinnacle of insight.

"In natural or artificial systems that require components to be integrated in some fashion, but where the number of components exceeds what could reasonably be fully interconnected (due to square wise growth in number of connections (= n over two or = n * (n - 1) / 2)), one often finds that some degree of hierarchicality must be employed in the solution. The general advantages of sparse hierarchical systems over densely connected systems—and quantitative estimates of these advantage—are presented by .
",4687
"In prosaic terms, a hierarchy is ""a collection of elements that combine lawfully into complex wholes which depend for their properties upon those of their constituent parts,"" and wherein novelty is ""fundamentally combinatorial, iterative, and transparent"" . An important notion that always arises in connection with hierarchies is modularity, which is effectively implied by the sparseness of connections in hierarchical topologies. In physical systems, a module is generally a set of interacting components that relates to the external world via a very limited interface, thus concealing most aspects of its internal structure.

"The earlier investigators reported regeneration of cotton plantlets on medium containing glucose (Trolinder and Goodin, 1987; Firoozabady et al., 1987; Rajasekaran, 1996; Kumar et al., 1998), maltose (Cousins et al., 1991; Kumria et al., 2003; Hussain et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2005a) and sucrose (Zhang and Li, 1992; GonzalezBenito et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2000 ; Sakhanokho et al., 2004).
",4689
"As a result, modifications that are made to the internals of a module (to improve efficiency for example) do not necessarily create a ripple effect through the rest of the system . This feature makes the effective use of modularity a centerpiece of all good software and hardware engineering. There are many compelling arguments regarding the prevalence and necessity of hierarchy/modularity in nature .
",4690
"This would be a fortunate state of affairs since the existence of simple and isolable subsystems is thought to be a precondition for successful science . In any case, experience certainly seems to indicate that much of the world possesses hierarchical structure. It has been proposed that perception itself is a process of hierarchical decomposition , and that phenomena which are not essentially hierarchical in nature may not even be ""theoretically intelligible"" to the human mind (,). In Simon's words, Practical applications of functional decomposition are found in Bayesian networks, structural equation modeling, linear systems, and database systems.
",4691
"Processes related to functional decomposition are prevalent throughout the fields of knowledge representation and machine learning. Hierarchical model induction techniques such as Logic circuit minimization, decision trees, grammatical inference, hierarchical clustering, and quadtree decomposition are all examples of function decomposition. A review of other applications and function decomposition can be found in , which also presents methods based on information theory and graph theory. Many statistical inference methods can be thought of as implementing a function decomposition process in the presence of noise; that is, where functional dependencies are only expected to hold ""approximately"".
",4692
"Among such models are mixture models and the recently popular methods referred to as ""causal decompositions"" or Bayesian networks. See database normalization. In practical scientific applications, it is almost never possible to achieve perfect functional decomposition because of the incredible complexity of the systems under study. This complexity is manifested in the presence of ""noise,"" which is just a designation for all the unwanted and untraceable influences on our observations. However, while perfect functional decomposition is usually impossible, the spirit lives on in a large number of statistical methods that are equipped to deal with noisy systems.
",4693
"When a natural or artificial system is intrinsically hierarchical, the joint distribution on system variables should provide evidence of this hierarchical structure. The task of an observer who seeks to understand the system is then to infer the hierarchical structure from observations of these variables. This is the notion behind the hierarchical decomposition of a joint distribution, the attempt to recover something of the intrinsic hierarchical structure which generated that joint distribution. As an example, Bayesian network methods attempt to decompose a joint distribution along its causal fault lines, thus ""cutting nature at its seams"".
",4694
"The essential motivation behind these methods is again that within most systems (natural or artificial), relatively few components/events interact with one another directly on equal footing . Rather, one observes pockets of dense connections (direct interactions) among small subsets of components, but only loose connections between these densely connected subsets. There is thus a notion of ""causal proximity"" in physical systems under which variables naturally precipitate into small clusters. Identifying these clusters and using them to represent the joint provides the basis for great efficiency of storage (relative to the full joint distribution) as well as for potent inference algorithms.
",4695
"Functional Decomposition is a design method intending to produce a non-implementation, architectural description of a computer program. Rather than conjecturing Objects and adding methods to them (OOP), with each Object intending to capture some service of the program, the software architect first establishes a series of functions and types that accomplishes the main processing problem of the computer program, decomposes each to reveal common functions and types, and finally derives Modules from this activity.
",4696
"points out that among evolving systems, only those that can manage to obtain and then reuse stable subassemblies (modules) are likely to be able to search through the fitness landscape with a reasonably quick pace; thus, Simon submits that ""among possible complex forms, hierarchies are the ones that have the time to evolve."" This line of thinking has led to the even stronger claim that although ""we do not know what forms of life have evolved on other planets in the universe, ... we can safely assume that 'wherever there is life, it must be hierarchically organized'"" .
",4697
"To contrast, in OOP, it is a common practice to conjecture Modules prior to considering such a decomposition. This arguably results in costly refactoring later. FD mitigates that risk to some extent. Further, arguably, what separates FD from other design methods- is that it provides a concise high-level medium of architectural discourse that is end-to-end, revealing flaws in upstream requirements and beneficially exposing more design decisions in advance. And lastly, FD is known to prioritize development.
",4698
"Arguably, if the FD is correct, the most re-usable and cost-determined parts of the program are identified far earlier in the development cycle. Functional decomposition is used in the analysis of many signal processing systems, such as LTI systems. The input signal to an LTI system can be expressed as a function, formula_52. Then formula_52 can be decomposed into a linear combination of other functions, called component signals: Here, formula_55 are the component signals. Note that formula_56 are constants.
",4699
"This decomposition aids in analysis, because now the output of the system can be expressed in terms of the components of the input. If we let formula_57 represent the effect of the system, then the output signal is formula_58, which can be expressed as: In other words, the system can be seen as acting separately on each of the components of the input signal. Commonly used examples of this type of decomposition are the Fourier series and the Fourier transform. Functional decomposition in systems engineering refers to the process of defining a system in functional terms, then defining lower-level functions and sequencing relationships from these higher level systems functions.

"The basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of a block diagram can be described without an ""and"" or ""or"" in the description. This exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure function. When a system is designed as pure functions, they can be reused, or replaced. A usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic. Since the interfaces usually become simple, it is easier to replace a pure function with a related, similar function. For example, say that one needs to make a stereo system.

However, as analytical techniques evolve and new knowledge about ecological processes and contaminant effects disseminate, the focus of monitoring will likely broaden over time and the quality of monitoring will continue to improve.

Boas studied 17,821 people, divided into seven ethno-national groups. Boas found that average measures of the cranial size of immigrants were significantly different from members of these groups who were born in the United States.

"Almost all mainstream environmentalism monitoring projects form part of an overall monitoring strategy or research field, and these field and strategies are themselves derived from the high levels objectives or aspirations of an organisation. Unless individual monitoring projects fit into a wider strategic framework, the results are unlikely to be published and the environmental understanding produced by the monitoring will be lost. ""see also Freshwater environmental quality parameters"" The range of chemical parameters that have the potential to affect any ecosystem is very large and in all monitoring programmes it is necessary to target a suite of parameters based on local knowledge and past practice for an initial review.
",4745
"The list can be expanded or reduced based on developing knowledge and the outcome of the initial surveys. Freshwater environments have been extensively studied for many years and there is a robust understanding of the interactions between chemistry and the environment across much of the world. However, as new materials are developed and new pressures come to bear, revisions to monitoring programmes will be required. In the last 20 years acid rain, synthetic hormone analogues, halogenated hydrocarbons, greenhouse gases and many others have required changes to monitoring strategies.

"In recent years much more attention has been given to a more holistic approach in which the ecosystem health is assessed and used as the monitoring tool itself. It is this approach that underpins the monitoring protocols of the Water Framework Directive in the European Union. Radiation monitoring involves the measurement of radiation dose or radionuclide contamination for reasons related to the assessment or control of exposure to ionizing radiation or radioactive substances, and the interpretation of the results. The ‘measurement’ of dose often means the measurement of a dose equivalent quantity as a proxy (i.e. substitute) for a dose quantity that cannot be measured directly.

"Moreover, they applied new statistical, computer-assisted methods to Boas's data and discovered more evidence for cranial plasticity. In a later publication, Gravlee, Bernard and Leonard reviewed Sparks and Jantz's analysis. They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas's claims and that Sparks's and Jantz's data actually support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment.

"Lahore's modern cityscape consists of the historic Walled City of Lahore in the northern part of the city, which contains several world and national heritage sites. Lahore's urban planning was not based on geometric design but was instead built piecemeal, with small cul-de-sacs, ""katrahs"" and ""galis"" developed in the context of neighbouring buildings.

"Almost all monitoring (except perhaps remote sensing) is in some part invasive of the environment under study and extensive and poorly planned monitoring carries a risk of damage to the environment. This may be a critical consideration in wilderness areas or when monitoring very rare organisms or those that are averse to human presence. Some monitoring techniques, such as gill netting fish to estimate populations, can be very damaging, at least to the local population and can also degrade public trust in scientists carrying out the monitoring.

"In 1888, he declared that ""the development of ethnology is largely due to the general recognition of the principle of biological evolution""; since Boas's times, physical anthropologists have established that the human capacity for culture is a product of human evolution. In fact, Boas's research on changes in body form played an important role in the rise of Darwinian theory. Boas was trained at a time when biologists had no understanding of genetics; Mendelian genetics became widely known only after 1900. Prior to that time biologists relied on the measurement of physical traits as empirical data for any theory of evolution.
",4752
"Boas's biometric studies, however, led him to question the use of this method and kind of data. In a speech to anthropologists in Berlin in 1912, Boas argued that at best such statistics could only raise biological questions, and not answer them. It was in this context that anthropologists began turning to genetics as a basis for any understanding of biological variation. Boas also contributed greatly to the foundation of linguistics as a science in the United States.

"There are a number of commercial software packages which can assist with the implementation of the programme, monitor its progress and flag up inconsistencies or omissions but none of these can provide the key building block which is the programme itself. Given the multiple types and increasing volumes and importance of monitoring data, commercial software Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS) or E-MDMS are increasingly in common use by regulated industries. They provide a means of managing all monitoring data in a single central place. Quality validation, compliance checking, verifying all data has been received, and sending alerts are generally automated.

"Typical interrogation functionality enables comparison of data sets both temporarily and spatially. They will also generate regulatory and other reports. One formal certification scheme exists specifically for environmental data management software. This is provided by the Environment Agency in the U.K. under its Monitoring Certification Scheme (MCERTS). There are a wide range of sampling methods which depend on the type of environment, the material being sampled and the subsequent analysis of the sample. At its simplest a sample can be filling a clean bottle with river water and submitting it for conventional chemical analysis.
",4755
"At the more complex end, sample data may be produced by complex electronic sensing devices taking sub-samples over fixed or variable time periods. In judgmental sampling, the selection of sampling units (i.e., the number and location and/or timing of collecting samples) is based on knowledge of the feature or condition under investigation and on professional judgment. Judgmental sampling is distinguished from probability-based sampling in that inferences are based on professional judgment, not statistical scientific theory. Therefore, conclusions about the target population are limited and depend entirely on the validity and accuracy of professional judgment; probabilistic statements about parameters are not possible.
",4756
"He immediately establishes that he is not concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive linguistics: when studying a new language, how are we to note the pronunciation of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between phonemics and phonetics.)
",4757
"People may pronounce a word in a variety of ways and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not ""that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality"" (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds ""are classified according to their similarity"" (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word ""green"" can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints.
",4758
"Additionally, simple random sampling can be more costly than other plans if difficulties in obtaining samples due to location causes an expenditure of extra effort. In stratified sampling, the target population is separated into non-overlapping strata, or subpopulations that are known or thought to be more homogeneous (relative to the environmental medium or the contaminant), so that there tends to be less variation among sampling units in the same stratum than among sampling units in different strata.
",4759
"In the past, researchers have interpreted this data in a number of ways—it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different dialects. Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit pronounce the word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word. It is not that English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the phonetic system of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound.
",4760
"Although Boas was making a very specific contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that what appeared to be evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority.
",4761
"Random systematic sampling is used to search for hot spots and to infer means, percentiles, or other parameters and is also useful for estimating spatial patterns or trends over time. This design provides a practical and easy method for designating sample locations and ensures uniform coverage of a site, unit, or process. Ranked set sampling is an innovative design that can be highly useful and cost efficient in obtaining better estimates of mean concentration levels in soil and other environmental media by explicitly incorporating the professional judgment of a field investigator or a field screening measurement method to pick specific sampling locations in the field.
",4762
"Ranked set sampling uses a two-phase sampling design that identifies sets of field locations, utilizes inexpensive measurements to rank locations within each set, and then selects one location from each set for sampling. In ranked set sampling, m sets (each of size r) of field locations are identified using simple random sampling. The locations are ranked independently within each set using professional judgment or inexpensive, fast, or surrogate measurements. One sampling unit from each set is then selected (based on the observed ranks) for subsequent measurement using a more accurate and reliable (hence, more expensive) method for the contaminant of interest.
",4763
"Relative to simple random sampling, this design results in more representative samples and so leads to more precise estimates of the population parameters. Ranked set sampling is useful when the cost of locating and ranking locations in the field is low compared to laboratory measurements. It is also appropriate when an inexpensive auxiliary variable (based on expert knowledge or measurement) is available to rank population units with respect to the variable of interest. To use this design effectively, it is important that the ranking method and analytical method are strongly correlated. In adaptive cluster sampling, samples are taken using simple random sampling, and additional samples are taken at locations where measurements exceed some threshold value.
",4764
"Although other anthropologists at the time, such as Bronisław Malinowski and Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown focused on the study of societies, which they understood to be clearly bounded, Boas's attention to history, which reveals the extent to which traits diffuse from one place to another, led him to view cultural boundaries as multiple and overlapping, and as highly permeable. Thus, Boas's student Robert Lowie once described culture as a thing of ""shreds and patches"".
",4765
"Boas's empirical field research, however, led him to argue against this comparison. For example, his 1903 essay, ""Decorative Designs of Alaskan Needlecases: A History of Conventional Designs, Based on Materials in a U.S. Museum"", provides another example of how Boas made broad theoretical claims based on a detailed analysis of empirical data. After establishing formal similarities among the needlecases, Boas shows how certain formal features provide a vocabulary out of which individual artisans could create variations in design.
",4766
"Grab samples are samples taken of a homogeneous material, usually water, in a single vessel. Filling a clean bottle with river water is a very common example. Grab samples provide a good snap-shot view of the quality of the sampled environment at the point of sampling and at the time of sampling. Without additional monitoring, the results cannot be extrapolated to other times or to other parts of the river, lake or ground-water.
",4767
"Several additional rounds of sampling and analysis may be needed. Adaptive cluster sampling tracks the selection probabilities for later phases of sampling so that an unbiased estimate of the population mean can be calculated despite oversampling of certain areas. An example application of adaptive cluster sampling is delineating the borders of a plume of contamination. Adaptive sampling is useful for estimating or searching for rare characteristics in a population and is appropriate for inexpensive, rapid measurements. It enables delineating the boundaries of hot spots, while also using all data collected with appropriate weighting to give unbiased estimates of the population mean.
",4768
"Strata may be chosen on the basis of spatial or temporal proximity of the units, or on the basis of preexisting information or professional judgment about the site or process. Advantages of this sampling design are that it has potential for achieving greater precision in estimates of the mean and variance, and that it allows computation of reliable estimates for population subgroups of special interest. Greater precision can be obtained if the measurement of interest is strongly correlated with the variable used to make the strata. In systematic and grid sampling, samples are taken at regularly spaced intervals over space or time.
",4769
"The trigger in this case may be a remote rain gauge communicating with the sampler by using cell phone or meteor burst technology. Samplers can also take individual discrete samples at each sampling occasion or bulk up samples into composite so that in the course of one day, such a sampler might produce 12 composite samples each composed of 6 sub-samples taken at 20-minute intervals. Continuous or quasi-continuous monitoring involves having an automated analytical facility close to the environment being monitored so that results can, if required, be viewed in real time.
",4770
"In order to enable grab samples or rivers to be treated as representative, repeat transverse and longitudinal transect surveys taken at different times of day and times of year are required to establish that the grab-sample location is as representative as is reasonably possible. For large rivers such surveys should also have regard to the depth of the sample and how to best manage the sampling locations at times of flood and drought. In lakes grab samples are relatively simple to take using depth samplers which can be lowered to a pre-determined depth and then closed trapping a fixed volume of water from the required depth.
",4771
"Such systems are often established to protect important water supplies such as in the River Dee regulation system but may also be part of an overall monitoring strategy on large strategic rivers where early warning of potential problems is essential. Such systems routinely provide data on parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and colour but it is also possible to operate gas liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry technologies (GLC/MS) to examine a wide range of potential organic pollutants. In all examples of automated bank-side analysis there is a requirement for water to be pumped from the river into the monitoring station.
",4772
"Passive samplers are semi-disposable and can be produced at a relatively low cost, thus they can be employed in great numbers, allowing for a better cover and more data being collected. Due to being small the passive sampler can also be hidden, and thereby lower the risk of vandalism.
",4773
"Examples of passive sampling devices are the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) sampler, Chemcatcher, Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS), semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs), stabilized liquid membrane devices (SLMDs), and an air sampling pump. Although on-site data collection using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote access to data in real time.
",4774
"This requires the on-site monitoring equipment to be connected to a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded.
",4775
"The use of remote surveillance also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short whip aerial protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public. Environmental remote sensing uses aircraft or satellites to monitor the environment using multi-channel sensors. There are two kinds of remote sensing. Passive sensors detect natural radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed.
",4776
"Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors and in environmental remote sensing, the sensors used are tuned to specific wavelengths from far infrared through visible light frequencies to the far ultraviolet. The volumes of data that can be collected are very large and require dedicated computational support. The output of data analysis from remote sensing are false colour images which differentiate small differences in the radiation characteristics of the environment being monitored. With a skilful operator choosing specific channels it is possible to amplify differences which are imperceptible to the human eye.
",4777
"In particular it is possible to discriminate subtle changes in chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b concentrations in plants and show areas of an environment with slightly different nutrient regimes. Active remote sensing emits energy and uses a passive sensor to detect and measure the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. LIDAR is often used to acquire information about the topography of an area, especially when the area is large and manual surveying would be prohibitively expensive or difficult. Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas.
",4778
"Boas was passionate about the collection of folklore and believed that the similarity of folktales amongst different folk groups was due to dissemination. Boas strove to prove this theory, and his efforts produced a method for breaking a folktale into parts and then analyzing these parts. His creation of ""catch-words"" allowed for categorization of these parts, and the ability to analyze them in relation to other similar tales. Boas also fought to prove that not all cultures progressed along the same path, and that non-European cultures, in particular, were not primitive, but different.

"Remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the Amazon Basin, the effects of climate change on glaciers and Arctic and Antarctic regions, and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths. Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides information to monitor trends such as El Niño and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the earth sciences such as natural resource management, land use planning and conservation. The use of living organisms as monitoring tools has many advantages.

"For grasslands and other low growing habitats the use of a quadrat – a 1-metre square frame – is often used with the numbers and types of organisms growing within each quadrat area counted Sediments and soils require specialist sampling tools to ensure that the material recovered is representative. Such samplers are frequently designed to recover a specified volume of material and may also be designed to recover the sediment or soil living biota as well such as the Ekman grab sampler. The interpretation of environmental data produced from a well designed monitoring programme is a large and complex topic addressed by many publications.
",4781
"Regrettably it is sometimes the case that scientists approach the analysis of results with a pre-conceived outcome in mind and use or misuse statistics to demonstrate that their own particular point of view is correct. Statistics remains a tool that is equally easy to use or to misuse to demonstrate the lessons learnt from environmental monitoring. Since the start of science-based environmental monitoring, a number of quality indices have been devised to help classify and clarify the meaning of the considerable volumes of data involved.

"More importantly, he viewed the Inuit as his teachers, thus reversing the typical hierarchical relationship between scientist and object of study. This emphasis on the relationship between anthropologists and those they study—the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human—implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the prism of their culture.

"Stating that a river stretch is in ""Class B"" is likely to be much more informative than stating that this river stretch has a mean BOD of 4.2, a mean dissolved oxygen of 85%, etc. In the UK the Environment Agency formally employed a system called General Quality Assessment (GQA) which classified rivers into six quality letter bands from A to F based on chemical criteria and on biological criteria.

"Moreover, he did not believe that detachment, objectivity, and quantifiability was required to make anthropology scientific. Since the object of study of anthropologists is different from the object of study of physicists, he assumed that anthropologists would have to employ different methods and different criteria for evaluating their research.

"Thus, Boas used statistical studies to demonstrate the extent to which variation in data is context-dependent, and argued that the context-dependent nature of human variation rendered many abstractions and generalizations that had been passing as scientific understandings of humankind (especially theories of social evolution popular at the time) in fact unscientific. His understanding of ethnographic fieldwork began with the fact that the objects of ethnographic study (e.g.,  the Inuit of Baffin Island) were not just objects, but subjects, and his research called attention to their creativity and agency.

The data cable carries a read signal and write signal, both as differential binary signals: the two signal states correspond to the two possible differential signal polarities. The data represented by these signals is MFM, so the absolute signal states are not significant: the data is represented in the timing of the state transitions, like in floppy disk systems.

"Two unknown sides can be calculated from the law of sines: or The procedure for solving an AAS triangle is same as that for an ASA triangle: First, find the third angle by using the angle sum property of a triangle, then find the other two sides using the law of sines. In many cases, triangles can be solved given three pieces of information some of which are the lengths of the triangle's medians, altitudes, or angle bisectors.

"On other spheres, the angle (in radians) is equal to the length around the sphere divided by the radius.) Spherical geometry differs from planar Euclidean geometry, so the solution of spherical triangles is built on different rules. For example, the sum of the three angles depends on the size of the triangle. In addition, similar triangles cannot be unequal, so the problem of constructing a triangle with specified three angles has a unique solution. The basic relations used to solve a problem are similar to those of the planar case: see Spherical law of cosines and Spherical law of sines.

"Once the heads are properly positioned and the appropriate head is selected, data is read or written serially through a set of pins in the data cable. The limited bandwidth of the data cable was not an issue at the time and is not the factor that limited the performance of the system. However, the unshielded cable can sometimes be susceptible to high levels of noise. The ST412 disk drive, among other improvements, added ""buffered seek"" capability to the interface. In this mode, the controller can send STEP pulses to the drive as fast as it can receive them, without having to wait for the mechanism to settle.

"This allows a single ""controller"" card—really just an interface card—to communicate with multiple dissimilar drives, while it also reduces latency and noise between the controller and drive hardware. Effectively, the roles are reversed: instead of the controller doing almost all of the complex processing and the drive just transferring encoded data between the magnetic disks and the controller, the drive does almost all of the complex processing and the ""controller"" just transfers decoded data between the drive and the host system.

"From the spherical law of cosines we infer: The above algorithms become much simpler if one of the angles of a triangle (for example, the angle ) is the right angle. Such a spherical triangle is fully defined by its two elements, and the other three can be calculated using Napier's Pentagon or the following relations. If one wants to measure the distance from shore to a remote ship via triangulation, one marks on the shore two points with known distance between them (the baseline). Let be the angles between the baseline and the direction to the ship.

"While integrated controllers have many benefits, they also have a disadvantage: the mechanical drive (called the ""head-disk assembly"", or HDA) and the controller are effectively fused into a monolithic black box, so that if something goes wrong with the drive, it is nearly impossible to do anything about it—the data is usually irretrievably lost. With a separated controller and disk system like that of the ST506 interface, sometimes the problem can be resolved by connecting the disk drive, containing the actual (perhaps very important) data, to another compatible controller.
",4798
"Furthermore, an ST506 style interface makes it possible and easy not only to replace the controller without throwing away the data, but to get access to the analog data signals from the disk drive and process them through a special data recovery system that may be able to reconstruct data that a normal controller cannot read. Such data recovery techniques are much more difficult to execute on integrated drives, because the needed analog signals from the disk are not available at a standard interface and the internal data recording method, sector format, and disk organization of nearly every integrated drive model is different and secret.

"His chief activity, however, centered on the elaboration of his ""Comparative Grammar"", which appeared in six parts at considerable intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847, 1849, 1852), under the title ""Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Zend, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litthauischen, Altslawischen, Gotischen und Deutschen"" (""Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend [Avestan], Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavonic, Gothic and German"").

"Hamlet Isakhanli is recognised as a scholar of great research capacity in mathematics. He has performed research in various areas of mathematics and the applied sciences such as non-self-adjoint operator theory, multiparameter spectral theory, the theory of joint spectra, differential equations, numerical ranges, and mathematical models of economy. He is considered one of the founders of the modern Multiparameter Spectral Theory. He was the first Soviet mathematician to carry out scientific research in this field of study, which has its origin in mathematical physics.

"As Bopp based his research on the best available sources and incorporated every new item of information that came to light, his work continued to widen and deepen in the making, as can be witnessed from his monographs on the vowel system in the Teutonic languages (1836), on the Celtic languages (1839), on the Old Prussian (1853) and Albanian languages (""Über das Albanesische in seinen verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen"", Vienna, 1854), on the accent in Sanskrit and Greek (1854), on the relationship of the Malayo-Polynesian to the Indo-European languages (1840), and on the Caucasian languages (1846).
",4815
"Critics have charged Bopp with neglecting the study of the native Sanskrit grammars, but in those early days of Sanskrit studies, the great libraries of Europe did not hold the requisite materials; if they had, those materials would have demanded his full attention for years, and such grammars as those of Charles Wilkins and Henry Thomas Colebrooke, from which Bopp derived his grammatical knowledge, had all used native grammars as a basis.
",4816
"The further charge that Bopp, in his ""Comparative Grammar"", gave undue prominence to Sanskrit is disproved by his own words; for, as early as 1820, he gave it as his opinion that frequently, the cognate languages serve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in Sanskrit (""Annals of Or. Lit."" i. 3), which he further developed in all his subsequent writings.

"Peasant farmers accustomed to hard work in the Mezzogiorno, for example, took jobs building railroads and constructing buildings, while others took factory jobs that required little or no skill.

"Major factors that contributed to the large exodus from both northern and southern Italy after unification included political and social unrest, the government's allocation of much more of its resources to the industrialization of the North than to that of the South, an inequitable tax burden on the South, tariffs on the products of the South, soil exhaustion and erosion, and military conscription lasting seven years.

"Flirting usually involves speaking and behaving in a way that suggests a mildly greater intimacy than the actual relationship between the parties would justify, though within the rules of social etiquette, which generally disapproves of a direct expression of sexual interest in the given setting. This may be accomplished by communicating a sense of playfulness or irony. Double entendres (where one meaning is more formally appropriate, and another more suggestive) may be used. Body language can include flicking the hair, eye contact, brief touching, open stances, proximity, and other gestures.
",4844
" Flirting or coquetry is a social and sexual behavior involving spoken or written communication, as well as body language, by one person to another, either to suggest interest in a deeper relationship with the other person, or if done playfully, for amusement. In most cultures, it is socially disapproved for a person to make explicit sexual advances in public, or in private to someone not romantically acquainted, but indirect or suggestive advances may at times be considered acceptable.

"Improvements in technology and programming, as well as reduced prices, led to a steady increase in license holders, and the number of licenses passed 1 million in October 1957.

"The ""Oxford English Dictionary"" (first edition) associates it with such onomatopoeic words as ""flit"" and ""flick"", emphasizing a lack of seriousness; on the other hand, it has been attributed to the old French ""conter fleurette"", which means ""to (try to) seduce"" by the dropping of flower petals, that is, ""to speak sweet nothings"". While old-fashioned, this expression is still used in French, often mockingly, but the English gallicism ""to flirt"" has made its way and has now become an anglicism.

"The word ""fleurette"" was used in the 16th century in some sonnets, and some other texts. The French word ""fleurette"" (small flower), and the language of old south France word ""flouretas"" (from the Latin ""flora""(for flower)), are related to some little says where flowers are both at the same time a pretext and the comparison terms.

"Nevertheless, the well-established ARD perceived the upstart ZDF as a competitor and reacted by beefing up its news coverage.

"Flirting may be done in an under-exaggerated, shy or frivolous style. Vocal communication of interest can include, for example, Flirting behavior varies across cultures due to different modes of social etiquette, such as how closely people should stand (proxemics), how long to hold eye contact, how much touching is appropriate and so forth. Nonetheless, some behaviors may be more universal.
",4851
"For example, kissing might be an early step in the American pattern but a relatively intimate act in the English pattern. Japanese courtesans had another form of flirting, emphasizing non-verbal relationships by hiding the lips and showing the eyes, as depicted in much Shunga art, the most popular print media at the time, until the late 19th century. The fan was extensively used as a means of communication and therefore a way of flirting from the 16th century onwards in some European societies, especially England and Spain. A whole sign language was developed with the use of the fan, and even etiquette books and magazines were published.
",4852
"Many people flirt as a courtship initiation method, with the aim of engaging in a sexual relationship with another person. In this sense, flirting plays a role in the mate-selection process. The person flirting will send out signals of sexual availability to another, and expects to see the interest returned in order to continue flirting. Flirting can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, and hair-touching; or verbal signs, such as chatting, giving flattering comments, and exchanging telephone numbers in order to initiate further contact. Many studies have confirmed that sex is a driving motivation for flirting behaviours.
",4853
"Additionally, Messman and colleagues' study provided support for this hypothesis; it demonstrated that, the more one was physically attracted to a person, the higher the chances one would flirt with them. Flirting in the goal of signalling interest appears as a puzzling phenomenon when considering that flirting is often performed very subtly. In fact, evidence shows that people are often mistaken in how they interpret flirting behaviours. Thus, if a main purpose of flirting is to signal interest to the other person, why isn't this signalling done more clearly and explicitly? A possible explanation, for the ambiguous nature of human flirting lies in the costs associated with courtship signals.
",4854
"Indeed, according to Gersick and colleagues, signalling interest can be costly as it can lead to the disturbance of the nature of a relationship. For instance, signalling sexual interest to a friend bears the risk of introducing uncertainty into the friendship, especially if the romantic advance is rejected by the recipient. For this reason, individuals prefer engaging in a flirting interaction that is more subtle to limit the risks associated with the expression of sexual interest. More generally, human relationships are governed by social norms and whenever these are broken, one can suffer significant costs that can range from social, economic and even legal nature.

"In Bergler's view, homosexuals differ from heterosexual neurotics because of their greater infantile fears ""centered on the mother image"" and their more extensive ""masochistic elaboration"". Bergler maintains that boys who become homosexuals try to make themselves independent of their mothers by unconsciously viewing their penises as equivalent to their mothers' breasts, based on the similarity in shape between the two organs and the fact that they both produce a fluid.

"I was staring unseeingly as the lights of the city flashed by until the lights were fewer and fewer in-between. That is when Naomi started speaking. ""I want to go over the plan again before we get there. This thing wants Cassandra rather badly. So we'll dangle her out there like the juiciest bait ever. The place we're going to used to be a prominent factory but has since become dilapidated and abandoned. It was used for a while as a warehouse so you might encounter empty pallets. She'll walk in first and then we'll be not far behind her.
",4857
"A last point to consider is that the costs associated with interest signalling are magnified in the case of humans, when compared to the animal world. Indeed, the existence of language means that information can circulate much faster. For instance, in the case of eavesdropping, the information overhead by the eavesdropper can be spread to very large social networks, thereby magnifying the social costs. Another reason people engage in flirting is to consolidate or maintain a romantic relationship with their partner. They will engage in flirting behaviours to promote the flourishing of their relationship with their partner.
",4858
"People will also flirt in the goal of 'exploring'. In this sense, the aim is not necessarily to express sexual or romantic interest but simply to assess whether the other might be interested in them before making any decision about what they would want from that individual. Henningsen and Fox also demonstrated that flirting can sometimes be employed just for fun. For instance, studies have shown that flirting in the workplace was used mostly for fun purposes. Another motive that drives flirting is developing one's own self esteem. People often feel highly valued when someone flirts with them.
",4859
"These findings are not surprising when the parental investment theory is taken into account. First, it states that females are more choosy and men more competitive, therefore predicting that flirting as courtship initiation will be more commonly used amongst men. The theory also predicts that females invest more in their offspring, which makes them more prone to invest in their relationship as this can provide resources that can contribute to their offspring's survival. On the other hand, men have no guarantee that their mates' offspring is theirs, so have less incentives to seek long-term relationships; thereby explaining why men care less about flirting for relationship development.
",4860
"Homosexuality of the positive magic gesture type involves a conflict between the unconscious ego and the inner conscience, which is expressed by performing a ""good dead"" toward a person such as a stranger, while that of the negative magic gesture type involves actions intended to show how the homosexual does not want to be treated. Homosexuality of the protective type involves a motive that Bergler describes as an attempt to show that ""father loves his little boy"". Homosexuality of the seeking the older protector type is found in homosexual men who search for partners who resemble good fathers who can love them, but unconsciously want to be mistreated by a ""bad mother"".
",4861
"Additionally, Henningsen found that flirting for fun was more common in females than males. A possible explanation for this could lie in the fact that women engage in what he calls ""practice flirting"". As women are more selective and want to attract the best partner to take care of their offspring, they might flirt for fun to practice and evaluate what flirting behaviours work the best. Flirting may consist of stylized gestures, language, body language, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to another person.
",4862
"Bergler considers all of these types to be based on an attempt to cope with unconscious masochism. Bergler discusses and criticizes writers such as Oscar Wilde, Herman Melville, Stendhal, Marcel Proust, and Somerset Maugham. He denies that homosexuals have special artistic gifts. Bergler argues that laws against homosexuality should not be repealed at present, though he allows that it might be appropriate to repeal them in the future if other measures against homosexuality proved effective.

"The distance between two people is also important when flirting. People from the ""contact cultures"", such as those in the Mediterranean or Latin America, may feel comfortable with closer proximity, whereas a British or Northern European person may typically need more space.

" Basal ganglia disease is a group of physical problems that occur when the group of nuclei in the brain known as the basal ganglia fail to properly suppress unwanted movements or to properly prime upper motor neuron circuits to initiate motor function. Research indicates that increased output of the basal ganglia inhibits thalamocortical projection neurons. Proper activation or deactivation of these neurons is an integral component for proper movement. If something causes too much basal ganglia output, then the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral lateral (VL) thalamocortical projection neurons become too inhibited, and one cannot initiate voluntary movement.

"These include the striatum, (composed of the putamen and caudate nucleus), globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus. Along with other structures, the basal ganglia are part of a neural circuit that is integral to voluntary motor function. It was once believed that the primary function of the basal ganglia was to integrate projections from the cerebral cortex, and project information via the thalamus to the motor cortex.
",4871
"Research has shown that the basal ganglia can be modeled as a group of components of parallel, re-entrant cortico-subcortical circuits, which originate in cortical areas, traverse the basal ganglia and terminate in specific areas in the frontal lobe. These areas are thought to control not only motor function but also oculomotor, prefrontal, associative, and limbic areas. Understanding these circuits has led to breakthroughs in understanding the disorders of the basal ganglia. Of all the circuits, the motor circuit is the most studied due its importance to motor disorders.

"For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances.

"This process is regulated by dopamine secreted by the striatum onto the D dopamine receptor on the SNc. Dopamine excites striatal neurons in the direct pathway.

"Other motor deficits and common non-motor features of Parkinson's such as autonomic dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and gait/balance difficulties, are thought to result from widespread progressive pathological changes commencing in the lower brain stem and ascending to the midbrain, amygdala, thalamus and ultimately the cerebral cortex. Hyperkinetic disorders are movement disorders characterized by increased uncontrollable motor function. They are caused by reduced basal ganglia output, which causes increased thalamocortical function which leads to the inability to stop unwanted movement.
",4880
"This degeneration of striatal neurons projecting to GPe leads to disinhibition of the indirect pathway, increased inhibition of the subthalamic nucleus, and therefore, reduced output of the basal ganglia. The neuronal degeneration eventually causes death within 10 to 20 years. Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that is characterized by involuntary movement and the slowing of intentional movement. Though there are known causes of dystonia such as metabolic, vascular, and structural abnormalities, there are still patients with dystonia with no apparent cause.
",4881
"However recent models in mice show that the dysfunction in the cerebellum may play an equal part in dystonia. . Hemiballismus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that causes uncontrolled movement on one side of the body. It is generally caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
",4882
"Similar to the direct pathway, the indirect pathway is regulated by striatal dopamine. D dopamine receptors inhibit transmission via the indirect pathway. D receptors inhibit striatal neurons in the indirect, inhibitory pathway. This inhibitory effect of dopamine on the indirect pathway serves the same function as its excitatory effects in the direct pathway in that it reduces basal ganglia output, leading to the disinhibition of motor neurons. Hypokinetic disorders are movement disorders that are described as having reduced motor function.
",4883
"For this reason, it is commonly believed that pathologies involving limbic, associative and motor circuits of the basal ganglia are likely. Since the realization that syndromes such as Tourette syndrome and OCD are caused by dysfunction of the non-motor loops of basal ganglia circuits, new treatments for these disorders, based on treatments originally designed to treat movement disorders are being developed. Sydenham's chorea is a disorder characterized by rapid, uncoordinated jerking movements primarily affecting the face, hands and feet.

"It is a result of an autoimmune response that occurs following infection by group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) that destroys cells in the corpus striatum of the basal ganglia. PANDAS is a hypothesis that there exists a subset of children with rapid onset of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) or tic disorders and that these symptoms are caused by group A β-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections.

"Within the first few years of life, extrapyramidal involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis) and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). The resemblance to dyskinetic cerebral palsy is apparent, and as a result most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. Psychological behaviours can include rejecting desired treats or travel, repaying kindness with coldness or rage, failing to answer test questions correctly despite study and a desire to succeed or provoking anger from caregivers when affection is desired.

"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the copper-transport gene ""ATP7B"", leading to excess copper build-up. About half of those affected have neurological symptoms, including parkinsonism (most commonly cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia or slowed movements and a lack of balance) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia or dystonia. Fahr's disease is a rare, genetically dominant, inherited neurological disorder characterized by abnormal deposits of calcium, primarily in the basal ganglia.

"About 0.3–1.5% of people have asymptomatic basal ganglia calcifications. Blepharospasm is any abnormal contraction or twitch of the eyelid. Blepharospasm may come from abnormal functioning of the brain's basal ganglia. Many disorders of the basal ganglia are due to the dysfunction of a localized area. For this reason, gene therapy seems viable for neurodegenerative disorders. Gene therapy is performed by replacing diseased phenotypes with new genetic material. This process is still in the early stages but early results are promising.

"It is believed that the success of pallidotomies in reducing the effects of movement disorders may result from the interruption of abnormal neuronal activity in the GPi. This ablation technique can be viewed as simply removing a faulty piece of a circuit. With the damaged piece of the circuit removed, the healthy area of the circuit can continue normal function. Deep brain stimulation involves inserting, via stereotaxic surgery, electrodes into the sensorimotor area of the brain. These electrodes emit high-frequency stimulation to the implanted areas.
",4893
"Bilateral implantation is necessary for symmetric results as well as the ability to reduce the intensity and duration of off-periods as well increase the duration of on-periods. The most effective structures used for implantations for deep brain stimulation are the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). This is because it is safer and more effective to alter the influence of the basal ganglia on the thalamocortical nuclei than directly altering neural activity in upper motor neuron circuits. Deep brain stimulation is a more complicated process than other therapies such as ablation.

"In living organisms, the main physical and biochemical processes that are required for survival are regulated by diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is one form of diffusion and it is important in several metabolic processes of living cells. One vital role of facilitated diffusion is that it is the main mechanism behind the binding of Transcription Factors (TFs) to designated target sites on the DNA molecule. The in vitro model, which is a very well known method of facilitated diffusion, that takes place outside of a living cell, explains the 3-dimensional pattern of diffusion in the cytosol and the 1-dimensional diffusion along the DNA contour.

"Generoso Pope (1891–1950), the owner of a chain of Italian-language newspapers in major cities, stands out as the epitome of the Italian American ethnic political broker. He bought ""Il Progresso Italo-Americano"" in 1928 for $2 million; he doubled its circulation to 200,000 in New York City, making it the largest Italian-language paper in the country. He purchased additional papers in New York and Philadelphia, which became the chief source of political, social, and cultural information for the community.

"After carrying out extensive research on processes occurring out of the cell, this mechanism was generally accepted but there was a need to verify that this mechanism could take place in vivo or inside of living cells. Bauer & Metzler (2013) therefore carried out an experiment using a bacterial genome in which they investigated the average time for TF – DNA binding to occur.

"At many smaller papers, support for Mussolini, short-sighted opportunism, deference to political patrons who were not members of the Italian-American communities, and the necessity of making a living through periodicals with a small circulation, generally weakened the owners of Italian-language newspapers when they tried to become political brokers of the Italian American vote. James V. Donnaruma purchased Boston's ""La Gazzetta del Massachusetts"" in 1905. ""La Gazzetta"" enjoyed a wide readership in Boston's Italian community because it emphasized detailed coverage of local ethnic events and explained how events in Europe affected the community.

"In a system of facilitated diffusion of oxygen, there is a tight relationship between the ligand which is oxygen and the carrier which is either hemoglobin or myoglobin. This mechanism of facilitated diffusion of oxygen by hemoglobin or myoglobin was discovered and initiated by Wittenberg and Scholander.

"VFAX was directed to review the fighters in the USAF Light Weight Fighter competition, which led to the development of the F/A-18 Hornet as roughly a midsize fighter and attack aircraft. In 1994, Congress would reject Grumman proposals to the Navy to upgrade the Tomcat beyond the D model (such as the Super Tomcat 21, the cheaper QuickStrike version, and the more advanced Attack Super Tomcat 21). In the 1990s, with the pending retirement of the A-6 Intruder, the F-14 air-to-ground program was resurrected.

"Trials with live bombs had been carried out in the 1980s; the F-14 was cleared to use basic iron bombs in 1992. During Operation Desert Storm of the Gulf War, most air-to-ground missions were left to A-7, A-6 Intruder and F/A-18 Hornet squadrons, while the F-14s focused on air defense operations. Following Desert Storm, F-14As and F-14Bs underwent upgrades to avionics and cockpit displays to enable the use of precision munitions, enhance defensive systems, and apply structural improvements.

"The new avionics were comparable with the F-14D; these upgraded aircraft were designated F-14A (Upgrade) and F-14B (Upgrade) respectively. By 1994, Grumman and the Navy were proposing ambitious plans for Tomcat upgrades to plug the gap between the retirement of the A-6 and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet entering service. However, the upgrades would have taken too long to implement to meet the gap, and were priced in the billions. The U.S. Congress considered this too expensive for an interim solution.

"The wings have a two-spar structure with integral fuel tanks. Around 25% of the structure is made of titanium, including the wing box, wing pivots, and upper and lower wing skins; this is a light, rigid, and strong material. Electron beam welding was used in the construction of the titanium parts. The landing gear is very robust, in order to withstand catapult launches (takeoffs) and recoveries (landings) needed for carrier operations. It comprises a double nosewheel and widely spaced single main wheels.

"In order to select the proper device driver, NuBus included an ID scheme that allowed the cards to identify themselves to the host computer during startup. This meant that the user didn't have to configure the system, the bane of bus systems up to that point. For instance, with ISA the driver had to be configured not only for the card, but for any memory it required, the interrupts it used, and so on. NuBus required no such configuration, making it one of the first examples of ""plug-and-play"" architecture.

It was upgraded to NuBus 90 starting with the Macintosh Quadras and used into the mid-1990s. Early Quadras only supported the 20 MHz rate when two cards were talking to each other, since the motherboard controller was not upgraded. This was later addressed in the NuBus implementation on the 660AV and 840AV models. This improved NuBus controller was used in the first generation Power Macintosh 6100, 7100 and 8100 models. Later Power Mac models adopted Intel's PCI bus.

"On the downside, while this flexibility made NuBus much simpler for the user and device driver authors, it made things more difficult for the designers of the cards themselves. Whereas most ""simple"" bus systems were easily supported with a handful of input/output chips designed to be used with that CPU in mind, with NuBus every card and computer had to convert everything to a platform-agnostic ""NuBus world"". Typically this meant adding a NuBus controller chip between the bus and any I/O chips on the card, increasing costs.

"While this did result in fuel savings, the main reason not to use afterburner during carrier launches was that if an engine failed the F110's thrust in full afterburner would produce a yawing moment too abruptly for the pilot to correct. Thus the launch of an F-14D with afterburner was rare, while the F-14A required full afterburner unless very lightly loaded.
