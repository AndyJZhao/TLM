"In this paper , a novel method to learn the [[ intrinsic object structure ]] for << robust visual tracking >> is proposed .",4
The basic assumption is that the << parameterized object state >> lies on a [[ low dimensional manifold ]] and can be learned from training data .,5
"Based on this assumption , firstly we derived the [[ dimensionality reduction and density estimation algorithm ]] for << unsupervised learning of object intrinsic representation >> , the obtained non-rigid part of object state reduces even to 2 dimensions .",6
Secondly the << dynamical model >> is derived and trained based on this [[ intrinsic representation ]] .,7
Thirdly the learned [[ intrinsic object structure ]] is integrated into a << particle-filter style tracker >> .,8
We will show that this intrinsic object representation has some interesting properties and based on which the newly derived [[ dynamical model ]] makes << particle-filter style tracker >> more robust and reliable .,9

"However , the [[ sound quality ]] of << NAM and electrolaryngeal speech >> suffers from lack of naturalness .",25

An implementation on << devices >> that are highly portable but have [[ limited computational resources ]] would greatly contribute to its practical use .,28
In this paper we further implement << real-time VC >> on a [[ DSP ]] .,29
"To implement the two << speech enhancement systems >> based on [[ real-time VC ]] , one from NAM to a whispered voice and the other from electrolaryngeal speech to a natural voice , we propose several methods for reducing computational cost while preserving conversion accuracy .",30
